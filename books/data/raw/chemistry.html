<em data-effect="italics">Chemistry</em> is designed for the two-semester general chemistry course. For many students, this course provides the foundation to a career in chemistry, while for others, this may be their only college-level science course. As such, this textbook provides an important opportunity for students to learn the core concepts of chemistry and understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. The text has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most general chemistry courses. At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative features designed to enhance student learning. A strength of <em data-effect="italics">Chemistry</em> is that instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.
</p>
<p id="fs-id1166790245093"><span data-type="title">Coverage and Scope</span>Our <em data-effect="italics">Chemistry</em> textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general chemistry courses nationwide. We strive to make chemistry, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. With this objective in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts of chemical science. Topics are introduced within the context of familiar experiences whenever possible, treated with an appropriate rigor to satisfy the intellect of the learner, and reinforced in subsequent discussions of related content. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from chemistry educators dedicated to the project.

<p id="fs-idp32962032">Your alarm goes off and, after hitting &#8220;snooze&#8221; once or twice, you pry yourself out of bed. You make a cup of coffee to help you get going, and then you shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, and check your phone for messages. On your way to school, you stop to fill your car&#8217;s gas tank, almost making you late for the first day of chemistry class. As you find a seat in the classroom, you read the question projected on the screen: &#8220;Welcome to class! Why should we study chemistry?&#8221;</p>
<p id="fs-idp22452080">Do you have an answer? You may be studying chemistry because it fulfills an academic requirement, but if you consider your daily activities, you might find chemistry interesting for other reasons. Most everything you do and encounter during your day involves chemistry. Making coffee, cooking eggs, and toasting bread involve chemistry. The products you use&#8212;like soap and shampoo, the fabrics you wear, the electronics that keep you connected to your world, the gasoline that propels your car&#8212;all of these and more involve chemical substances and processes. Whether you are aware or not, chemistry is part of your everyday world. In this course, you will learn many of the essential principles underlying the chemistry of modern-day life.

<ul>
<li>Outline the historical development of chemistry</li>
<li>Provide examples of the importance of chemistry in everyday life</li>
<li>Describe the scientific method</li>
<li>Differentiate among hypotheses, theories, and laws</li>
<li>Provide examples illustrating macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains</li>

<p id="fs-idp77567568">Throughout human history, people have tried to convert matter into more useful forms. Our Stone Age ancestors chipped pieces of flint into useful tools and carved wood into statues and toys. These endeavors involved changing the shape of a substance without changing the substance itself. But as our knowledge increased, humans began to change the composition of the substances as well&#8212;clay was converted into pottery, hides were cured to make garments, copper ores were transformed into copper tools and weapons, and grain was made into bread.</p>
<p id="fs-idp55245024">Humans began to practice chemistry when they learned to control fire and use it to cook, make pottery, and smelt metals. Subsequently, they began to separate and use specific components of matter. A variety of drugs such as aloe, myrrh, and opium were isolated from plants. Dyes, such as indigo and Tyrian purple, were extracted from plant and animal matter. Metals were combined to form alloys&#8212;for example, copper and tin were mixed together to make bronze&#8212;and more elaborate smelting techniques produced iron. Alkalis were extracted from ashes, and soaps were prepared by combining these alkalis with fats. Alcohol was produced by fermentation and purified by distillation.</p><p id="fs-idp128238864">Attempts to understand the behavior of matter extend back for more than 2500 years. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers discussed a system in which water was the basis of all things. You may have heard of the Greek postulate that matter consists of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Subsequently, an amalgamation of chemical technologies and philosophical speculations were spread from Egypt, China, and the eastern Mediterranean by alchemists, who endeavored to transform &#8220;base metals&#8221; such as lead into &#8220;noble metals&#8221; like gold, and to create elixirs to cure disease and extend life (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_01_Alchemist" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp139124096">From alchemy came the historical progressions that led to modern chemistry: the isolation of drugs from natural sources, metallurgy, and the dye industry. Today, chemistry continues to deepen our understanding and improve our ability to harness and control the behavior of matter. This effort has been so successful that many people do not realize either the central position of chemistry among the sciences or the importance and universality of chemistry in daily life.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp71946416"><h1 data-type="title">Chemistry: The Central Science</h1>
<p id="fs-idm166568720">Chemistry is sometimes referred to as &#8220;the central science&#8221; due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields). Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_01_ChemWeb" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture, food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in the form of food and drink to the world&#8217;s population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the universe in astronomy and cosmology.</p>

<p id="fs-idm183676832">What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and assimilating food, synthesizing polymers that are used to make clothing, containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline and other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you will discover many different examples of changes in the composition and structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred, their causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws involved. As you learn about these things, you will be learning <span data-type="term">chemistry</span>, the study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp132288224"><h1 data-type="title">The Scientific Method</h1>
<p id="fs-idm19494768">Chemistry is a science based on observation and experimentation. Doing chemistry involves attempting to answer questions and explain observations in terms of the laws and theories of chemistry, using procedures that are accepted by the scientific community. There is no single route to answering a question or explaining an observation, but there is an aspect common to every approach: Each uses knowledge based on experiments that can be reproduced to verify the results. Some routes involve a <span data-type="term">hypothesis</span>, a tentative explanation of observations that acts as a guide for gathering and checking information. We test a hypothesis by experimentation, calculation, and/or comparison with the experiments of others and then refine it as needed.</p>
<p id="fs-idp4269776">Some hypotheses are attempts to explain the behavior that is summarized in laws. The <span data-type="term">laws</span> of science summarize a vast number of experimental observations, and describe or predict some facet of the natural world. If such a hypothesis turns out to be capable of explaining a large body of experimental data, it can reach the status of a theory. Scientific <span data-type="term">theories</span> are well-substantiated, comprehensive, testable explanations of particular aspects of nature. Theories are accepted because they provide satisfactory explanations, but they can be modified if new data become available. The path of discovery that leads from question and observation to law or hypothesis to theory, combined with experimental verification of the hypothesis and any necessary modification of the theory, is called the <span data-type="term">scientific method</span> (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_01_SciMethod" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_01_01_SciMethod"><figcaption>The scientific method follows a process similar to the one shown in this diagram. All the key components are shown, in roughly the right order.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm130146160"><h1 data-type="title">The Domains of Chemistry</h1>
<p id="fs-idm148555376">Chemists study and describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains: macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of considering and describing chemical behavior.</p>
<p id="fs-idm148595088">
<em data-effect="italics">Macro</em> is a Greek word that means &#8220;large.&#8221; The <span data-type="term">macroscopic domain</span> is familiar to us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical properties, or changes such as density, solubility, and flammability.</p>
<p id="fs-idp130311264">The <span data-type="term">microscopic domain</span> of chemistry is almost always visited in the imagination. <em data-effect="italics">Micro</em> also comes from Greek and means &#8220;small.&#8221; Some aspects of the microscopic domains are visible through a microscope, such as a magnified image of graphite or bacteria. Viruses, for instance, are too small to be seen with the naked eye, but when we&#8217;re suffering from a cold, we&#8217;re reminded of how real they are.</p>
<p id="fs-idp28442320">However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry&#8212;such as atoms and molecules&#8212;are too small to be seen even with standard microscopes and often must be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of which is far too small to see. This domain includes the individual metal atoms in a wire, the ions that compose a salt crystal, the changes in individual molecules that result in a color change, the conversion of nutrient molecules into tissue and energy, and the evolution of heat as bonds that hold atoms together are created.</p>
<p id="fs-idm166065136">The <span data-type="term">symbolic domain</span> contains the specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs and drawings. We can also consider calculations as part of the symbolic domain. These symbols play an important role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.</p>
<p id="fs-idm64529776">A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous substance of water. That water is a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher temperatures (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_01_WaterDom" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall into the microscopic domain&#8212;what we cannot observe with the naked eye. The description of water as comprised of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these molecules, is within the microscopic arena. The formula H<sub>2</sub>O, which can describe water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the symbolic domain. The abbreviations (<em data-effect="italics">g</em>) for gas, (<em data-effect="italics">s</em>) for solid, and (<em data-effect="italics">l</em>) for liquid are also symbolic.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_01_01_WaterDom"><figcaption>(a) Moisture in the air, icebergs, and the ocean represent water in the macroscopic domain. (b) At the molecular level (microscopic domain), gas molecules are far apart and disorganized, solid water molecules are close together and organized, and liquid molecules are close together and disorganized. (c) The formula H<sub>2</sub>O symbolizes water, and (<em data-effect="italics">g</em>), (<em data-effect="italics">s</em>), and (<em data-effect="italics">l</em>) symbolize its phases. Note that clouds are actually comprised of either very small liquid water droplets or solid water crystals; gaseous water in our atmosphere is not visible to the naked eye, although it may be sensed as humidity.

<p id="fs-idm14698032">Chemistry deals with the composition, structure, and properties of matter, and the ways by which various forms of matter may be interconverted. Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology. Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.</p>

For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it is composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of more than one state when it is a mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas) and tiny particles of water (liquid or solid).</p>
<p id="fs-idp46064176">The <span data-type="term">mass</span> of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to measure an object&#8217;s mass is to measure the force it takes to accelerate the object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the car has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is to use a balance to compare its mass with a standard mass.</p>
<p id="fs-idp63221808">Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing. <span data-type="term">Weight</span> refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object. This force is directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes as the force of gravity changes, but its mass does not. An astronaut&#8217;s mass does not change just because she goes to the moon. But her weight on the moon is only one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moon&#8217;s gravity is only one-sixth that of the earth&#8217;s. She may feel &#8220;weightless&#8221; during her trip when she experiences negligible external forces (gravitational or any other), although she is, of course, never &#8220;massless.&#8221;</p>
<p id="fs-idp40529184">The <span data-type="term">law of conservation of matter</span> summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that <em data-effect="italics">there is no detectable change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts from one type to another (a chemical change) or changes among solid, liquid, or gaseous states (a physical change)</em>. Brewing beer and the operation of batteries provide examples of the conservation of matter (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_02_ConsMatter" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). During the brewing of beer, the ingredients (water, yeast, grains, malt, hops, and sugar) are converted into beer (water, alcohol, carbonation, and flavoring substances) with no actual loss of substance. This is most clearly seen during the bottling process, when glucose turns into ethanol and carbon dioxide, and the total mass of the substances does not change. This can also be seen in a lead-acid car battery: The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable of producing electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and water) that do not produce electricity, with no change in the actual amount of matter.</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_01_02_ConsMatter"><figcaption>(a) The mass of beer precursor materials is the same as the mass of beer produced: Sugar has become alcohol and carbonation. (b) The mass of the lead, lead oxide plates, and sulfuric acid that goes into the production of electricity is exactly equal to the mass of lead sulfate and water that is formed.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idp109544240">Although this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter, convincing examples are few and far between because, outside of the controlled conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that is produced during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and assimilate food, all of the matter in the original food is preserved. But because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and much is excreted as various types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement.</p>

<p id="fs-idp25156032">An <span data-type="term">atom</span> is the smallest particle of an element that has the properties of that element and can enter into a chemical combination. Consider the element gold, for example. Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then cutting one of the halves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained that was so small that it could not be cut in half (regardless of how tiny your knife may be). This minimally sized piece of gold is an atom (from the Greek <em data-effect="italics">atomos</em>, meaning &#8220;indivisible&#8221;) (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_02_GoldAtoms" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).

<p id="fs-idm15008032">The first suggestion that matter is composed of atoms is attributed to the Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus, who developed their ideas in the 5th century BCE. However, it was not until the early nineteenth century that John <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Dalton</span> (1766&#8211;1844), a British schoolteacher with a keen interest in science, supported this hypothesis with quantitative measurements. Since that time, repeated experiments have confirmed many aspects of this hypothesis, and it has become one of the central theories of chemistry. Other aspects of Dalton&#8217;s atomic theory are still used but with minor revisions (details of Dalton&#8217;s theory are provided in the chapter on atoms and molecules).</p>
<p id="fs-idp64376128">An atom is so small that its size is difficult to imagine. One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided eye is a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about 1/10,000 of a centimeter (0.0001 cm) in diameter. Although the cross-section of one strand is almost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. A single carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter, and it would take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. To put this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, the cross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which would require about 150 million carbon atom &#8220;dimes&#8221; to cover it.

<p id="fs-idp23257696">It is rare to find collections of individual atoms. Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and argon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently of one another. Other elements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_02_Molecules" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). One form of the element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. The element sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composed of eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A <span data-type="term">molecule</span> consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemical bonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of soda in a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A molecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules found in the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or more different atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is a unit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule is a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass of water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it would be about the size of golf balls.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm129745056"><h1 data-type="title">Classifying Matter</h1>
<p id="fs-idm27277840">We can classify matter into several categories. Two broad categories are mixtures and pure substances. A <span data-type="term">pure substance</span> has a constant composition. All specimens of a pure substance have exactly the same makeup and properties. Any sample of sucrose (table sugar) consists of 42.1% carbon, 6.5% hydrogen, and 51.4% oxygen by mass. Any sample of sucrose also has the same physical properties, such as melting point, color, and sweetness, regardless of the source from which it is isolated.</p>
<p id="fs-idm96243408">We can divide pure substances into two classes: elements and compounds. Pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical changes are called <span data-type="term">elements</span>. Iron, silver, gold, aluminum, sulfur, oxygen, and copper are familiar examples of the more than 100 known elements, of which about 90 occur naturally on the earth, and two dozen or so have been created in laboratories.</p>
<p id="fs-idm75785376">Pure substances that can be broken down by chemical changes are called <span data-type="term">compounds</span>. This breakdown may produce either elements or other compounds, or both. Mercury(II) oxide, an orange, crystalline solid, can be broken down by heat into the elements mercury and oxygen (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_02_decomp" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). When heated in the absence of air, the compound sucrose is broken down into the element carbon and the compound water. (The initial stage of this process, when the sugar is turning brown, is known as caramelization&#8212;this is what imparts the characteristic sweet and nutty flavor to caramel apples, caramelized onions, and caramel). Silver(I) chloride is a white solid that can be broken down into its elements, silver and chlorine, by absorption of light. This property is the basis for the use of this compound in photographic films and photochromic eyeglasses (those with lenses that darken when exposed to light).</p><figure id="CNX_Chem_01_02_decomp"><figcaption>(a)The compound mercury(II) oxide, (b)when heated, (c) decomposes into silvery droplets of liquid mercury and invisible oxygen gas.

<p id="fs-idm50488272">The properties of combined elements are different from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example, white crystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemical combination of the element carbon, which is a black solid in one of its uncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen, which are colorless gases when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallic solid, and free chlorine, an element that is a yellow-green gas, combine to form sodium chloride (table salt), a compound that is a white, crystalline solid.</p>
<p id="fs-idm77724752">A <span data-type="term">mixture</span> is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical changes, such as evaporation (you will learn more about this later). A mixture with a composition that varies from point to point is called a <span data-type="term">heterogeneous mixture</span>. Italian dressing is an example of a heterogeneous mixture (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_02_Mixtures" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Its composition can vary because we can make it from varying amounts of oil, vinegar, and herbs. It is not the same from point to point throughout the mixture&#8212;one drop may be mostly vinegar, whereas a different drop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar separate and the herbs settle. Other examples of heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chip cookies (we can see the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough) and granite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar, and more).</p>
<p id="fs-idm12481392">A <span data-type="term">homogeneous mixture</span>, also called a <span data-type="term">solution</span>, exhibits a uniform composition and appears visually the same throughout. An example of a solution is a sports drink, consisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and electrolytes mixed together uniformly (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_02_Mixtures" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each drop contains the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that the composition of a sports drink can vary&#8212;it could be made with somewhat more or less sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still be a sports drink. Other examples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and a solution of salt in water.</p>

<p id="fs-idm107801696">Water consists of the elements hydrogen and oxygen combined in a 2 to 1 ratio. Water can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen gases by the addition of energy. One way to do this is with a battery or power supply, as shown in (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_01_Electrolys" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_01_01_Electrolys"><figcaption>The decomposition of water is shown at the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic levels. The battery provides an electric current (microscopic) that decomposes water. At the macroscopic level, the liquid separates into the gases hydrogen (on the left) and oxygen (on the right). Symbolically, this change is presented by showing how liquid H<sub>2</sub>O separates into H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> gases.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idm74337664">The two gases produced have distinctly different properties. Oxygen is not flammable but is required for combustion of a fuel, and hydrogen is highly flammable and a potent energy source. How might this knowledge be applied in our world? One application involves research into more fuel-efficient transportation. Fuel-cell vehicles (FCV) run on hydrogen instead of gasoline (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_01_FuelCell" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). They are more efficient than vehicles with internal combustion engines, are nonpolluting, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making us less dependent on fossil fuels. FCVs are not yet economically viable, however, and current hydrogen production depends on natural gas. If we can develop a process to economically decompose water, or produce hydrogen in another environmentally sound way, FCVs may be the way of the future.</p>

<p id="fs-idm49120320">Imagine how different your life would be without cell phones (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_02_CellPhone" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) and other smart devices. Cell phones are made from numerous chemical substances, which are extracted, refined, purified, and assembled using an extensive and in-depth understanding of chemical principles. About 30% of the elements that are found in nature are found within a typical smart phone. The case/body/frame consists of a combination of sturdy, durable polymers comprised primarily of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen [acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate thermoplastics], and light, strong, structural metals, such as aluminum, magnesium, and iron. The display screen is made from a specially toughened glass (silica glass strengthened by the addition of aluminum, sodium, and potassium) and coated with a material to make it conductive (such as indium tin oxide). The circuit board uses a semiconductor material (usually silicon); commonly used metals like copper, tin, silver, and gold; and more unfamiliar elements such as yttrium, praseodymium, and gadolinium. The battery relies upon lithium ions and a variety of other materials, including iron, cobalt, copper, polyethylene oxide, and polyacrylonitrile.</p>

<p id="fs-idp42086864">Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The basic building block of matter is the atom, the smallest unit of an element that can enter into combinations with atoms of the same or other elements. In many substances, atoms are combined into molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in three states: solids, of fixed shape and volume; liquids, of variable shape but fixed volume; and gases, of variable shape and volume. Under high-temperature conditions, matter also can exist as a plasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical means. Heterogeneous mixtures vary in composition from point to point; homogeneous mixtures have the same composition from point to point. Pure substances consist of only one type of matter. A pure substance can be an element, which consists of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down by a chemical change, or a compound, which consists of two or more types of atoms.</p>

<p id="fs-idp58271744">The characteristics that enable us to distinguish one substance from another are called properties. A <span data-type="term">physical property</span> is a characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples of physical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling points, and electrical conductivity. We can observe some physical properties, such as density and color, without changing the physical state of the matter observed. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed as matter undergoes a physical change. A <span data-type="term">physical change</span> is a change in the state or properties of matter without any accompanying change in its chemical composition (the identities of the substances contained in the matter). We observe a physical change when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when steam condenses into liquid water (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_03_PhysChange" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and demagnetizing metals (as is done with common antitheft security tags) and grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes in color). In each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state, form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.</p>

<p id="fs-idp135749488">The change of one type of matter into another type (or the inability to change) is a <span data-type="term">chemical property</span>. Examples of chemical properties include flammability, toxicity, acidity, reactivity (many types), and heat of combustion. Iron, for example, combines with oxygen in the presence of water to form rust; chromium does not oxidize (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_03_Rust" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Nitroglycerin is very dangerous because it explodes easily; neon poses almost no hazard because it is very unreactive.</p>

<p id="fs-idp137402768">To identify a chemical property, we look for a chemical change. A <span data-type="term">chemical change</span> always produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change. The formation of rust is a chemical change because rust is a different kind of matter than the iron, oxygen, and water present before the rust formed. The explosion of nitroglycerin is a chemical change because the gases produced are very different kinds of matter from the original substance. Other examples of chemical changes include reactions that are performed in a lab (such as copper reacting with nitric acid), all forms of combustion (burning), and food being cooked, digested, or rotting (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_03_ChemChange" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp29966736">Properties of matter fall into one of two categories. If the property depends on the amount of matter present, it is an <span data-type="term">extensive property</span>. The mass and volume of a substance are examples of extensive properties; for instance, a gallon of milk has a larger mass and volume than a cup of milk. The value of an extensive property is directly proportional to the amount of matter in question. If the property of a sample of matter does not depend on the amount of matter present, it is an <span data-type="term">intensive property</span>. Temperature is an example of an intensive property. If the gallon and cup of milk are each at 20 &#176;C (room temperature), when they are combined, the temperature remains at 20 &#176;C. As another example, consider the distinct but related properties of heat and temperature. A drop of hot cooking oil spattered on your arm causes brief, minor discomfort, whereas a pot of hot oil yields severe burns. Both the drop and the pot of oil are at the same temperature (an intensive property), but the pot clearly contains much more heat (extensive property).</p>

<p id="fs-idp114795152">The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 704 Hazard Identification System was developed by NFPA to provide safety information about certain substances. The system details flammability, reactivity, health, and other hazards. Within the overall diamond symbol, the top (red) diamond specifies the level of fire hazard (temperature range for flash point). The blue (left) diamond indicates the level of health hazard. The yellow (right) diamond describes reactivity hazards, such as how readily the substance will undergo detonation or a violent chemical change. The white (bottom) diamond points out special hazards, such as if it is an oxidizer (which allows the substance to burn in the absence of air/oxygen), undergoes an unusual or dangerous reaction with water, is corrosive, acidic, alkaline, a biological hazard, radioactive, and so on. Each hazard is rated on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being no hazard and 4 being extremely hazardous.</p>

<p id="fs-idp147199744">While many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, some elements have similar properties. We can identify sets of elements that exhibit common behaviors. For example, many elements conduct heat and electricity well, whereas others are poor conductors. These properties can be used to sort the elements into three classes: metals (elements that conduct well), nonmetals (elements that conduct poorly), and metalloids (elements that have properties of both metals and nonmetals).</p>

<p id="fs-idp236281408">All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo physical or chemical changes. Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point, and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not involve a change in the composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and chemical changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from that present beforehand.</p>
<p id="fs-idp132347232">Measurable properties fall into one of two categories. Extensive properties depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the mass of gold. Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the density of gold. Heat is an example of an extensive property, and temperature is an example of an intensive property.</p>

<ul>
<li>Explain the process of measurement</li>
<li>Identify the three basic parts of a quantity</li>
<li>Describe the properties and units of length, mass, volume, density, temperature, and time</li>
<li>Perform basic unit calculations and conversions in the metric and other unit systems</li>
</ul></div>
<p id="fs-idm75764096">Measurements provide the macroscopic information that is the basis of most of the hypotheses, theories, and laws that describe the behavior of matter and energy in both the macroscopic and microscopic domains of chemistry. Every measurement provides three kinds of information: the size or magnitude of the measurement (a number); a standard of comparison for the measurement (a unit); and an indication of the uncertainty of the measurement. While the number and unit are explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more implicitly represented and will be discussed later.</p>
<p id="fs-idm128012432">The number in the measurement can be represented in different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation. (Scientific notation is also known as exponential notation; a review of this topic can be found in <a href="/contents/9e30ec42-520e-49d8-ab8b-177801a7dfae@4" class="target-chapter">Appendix B</a>.) For example, the maximum takeoff weight of a Boeing 777-200ER airliner is 298,000 kilograms, which can also be written as 2.98 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mo>&#215;</mo></annotation-xml></semantics></math> 10<sup>5</sup> kg. The mass of the average mosquito is about 0.0000025 kilograms, which can be written as 2.5 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mo>&#215;</mo></annotation-xml></semantics></math> 10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> kg.</p>
<p id="fs-idp178656"><span data-type="term">Units</span>, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for measurements. When we buy a 2-liter bottle of a soft drink, we expect that the volume of the drink was measured, so it is two times larger than the volume that everyone agrees to be 1 liter. The meat used to prepare a 0.25-pound hamburger is measured so it weighs one-fourth as much as 1 pound. Without units, a number can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a patient&#8217;s seizures and states a dosage of &#8220;100&#8221; without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing to the medical professional giving the dose, but the consequences can be dire: 100 mg given three times per day can be effective as an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of 100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount.</p>
<p id="fs-idm144392592">We usually report the results of scientific measurements in SI units, an updated version of the metric system, using the units listed in <a href="#fs-idm81346144" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Other units can be derived from these base units. The standards for these units are fixed by international agreement, and they are called the <span data-type="term">International System of Units</span> or <span data-type="term">SI Units</span> (from the French, <em data-effect="italics">Le Syst&#232;me International d&#8217;Unit&#233;s</em>).

<p id="eip-134">Sometimes we use units that are fractions or multiples of a base unit. Ice cream is sold in quarts (a familiar, non-SI base unit), pints (0.5 quart), or gallons (4 quarts). We also use fractions or multiples of units in the SI system, but these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI units are named using a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the prefix <em data-effect="italics">kilo</em> means &#8220;one thousand,&#8221; which in scientific notation is 10<sup>3</sup> (1 kilometer = 1000 m = 10<sup>3</sup> m). The prefixes used and the powers to which 10 are raised are listed in <a href="#fs-idm81128320" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>
<table id="fs-idm81128320" summary="The prefix femto has the symbol lowercase f and a factor of 10 to the negative fifteenth power. Therefore, 1 femtosecond, F S, is equal to 1 times 10 to the negative 15 of a meter, or 0.000000000001 of a meter. The prefix pico has the symbol lowercase P and a factor of 10 to the negative twelfth power. Therefore, 1 picosecond, P S, is equal to 1 times 10 to the negative 12 of a meter, or 0.000000000001 of a meter. The prefix nano has the symbol lowercase N and a factor of 10 to the negative ninth power. Therefore, 4 nanograms, or NG, equals 4 times ten to the negative 9, or 0.000000004 g. The prefix micro has the greek letter mu as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the negative sixth power. Therefore, 1 microliter, or mu L, is equal to one times ten to the negative 6 or 0.000001 L. The prefix milli has a lowercase M as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the negative third power. Therefore, 2 millimoles, or M mol, are equal to two times ten to the negative 3 or 0.002 mol. The prefix centi has a lowercase C as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the negative second power. Therefore, 7 centimeters, or C M, are equal to seven times ten to the negative 2 meters or 0.07 M O L. The prefix deci has a lowercase D as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the negative first power. Therefore, 1 deciliter, or lowercase D uppercase L, are equal to one times ten to the negative 1 meters or 0.1 L. The prefix kilo has a lowercase K as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the third power. Therefore, 1 kilometer, or K M, is equal to one times ten to the third meters or 1000 M. The prefix mega has an uppercase M as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the sixth power. Therefore, 3 megahertz, or M H Z, are equal to three times 10 to the sixth hertz, or 3000000 H Z. The prefix giga has an uppercase G as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the ninth power. Therefore, 8 gigayears, or G Y R, are equal to eight times 10 to the ninth years, or 800000000 G Y R. The prefix tera has an uppercase T as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the twelfth power.

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idp25374912"><h1 data-type="title">SI Base Units</h1>
<p id="fs-idp389936">The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI system, were established in France during the French Revolution. The original standards for the meter and the kilogram were adopted there in 1799 and eventually by other countries. This section introduces four of the SI base units commonly used in chemistry. Other SI units will be introduced in subsequent chapters.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp679312"><h2 data-type="title">Length</h2>
<p id="fs-idm64613648">The standard unit of <span data-type="term">length</span> in both the SI and original metric systems is the <span data-type="term">meter (m)</span>. A meter was originally specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light in a vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer than a yard (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_04_MYdCmIn" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>); one meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 10<sup>3</sup> m), whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m = 10<sup>&#8722;2</sup> m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001 m = 10<sup>&#8722;3</sup> m).</p>

<p id="fs-idp222999216">The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the <span data-type="term">kilogram (kg)</span>. A kilogram was originally defined as the mass of a liter of water (a cube of water with an edge length of exactly 0.1 meter). It is now defined by a certain cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy, which is kept in France (<a href="#CNX_Chem_01_04_Kilogram" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Any object with the same mass as this cylinder is said to have a mass of 1 kilogram. One kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. The gram (g) is exactly equal to 1/1000 of the mass of the kilogram (10<sup>&#8722;3</sup> kg).</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idm1531808"><h2 data-type="title">Temperature</h2>
<p id="fs-idp3379184">Temperature is an intensive property. The SI unit of temperature is the <span data-type="term">kelvin (K)</span>. The IUPAC convention is to use kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word &#8220;degree&#8221; nor the degree symbol (&#176;). The degree <span data-type="term">Celsius (&#176;C)</span> is also allowed in the SI system, with both the word &#8220;degree&#8221; and the degree symbol used for Celsius measurements. Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at 273.15 K (0 &#176;C) and boils at 373.15 K (100 &#176;C) by definition, and normal human body temperature is approximately 310 K (37 &#176;C). The conversion between these two units and the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this chapter.</p>

<p id="fs-idm10854912">We can derive many units from the seven SI base units. For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.</p>

<p id="fs-idm77137776">
<span data-type="term">Volume</span> is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object.

The standard volume is a <span data-type="term">cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>)</span>, a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.</p>
<p id="fs-idm81813264">A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10 cm). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter (dm<sup>3</sup>).

Gold&#8212;in bricks, bars, and coins&#8212;has been a form of currency for centuries. In order to swindle people into paying for a brick of gold without actually investing in a brick of gold, people have considered filling the centers of hollow gold bricks with lead to fool buyers into thinking that the entire brick is gold. It does not work: Lead is a dense substance, but its density is not as great as that of gold, 19.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. What is the density of lead if a cube of lead has an edge length of 2.00 cm and a mass of 90.7 g?</p>
<p id="fs-idp40298832"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>
The density of a substance can be calculated by dividing its mass by its volume. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the edge length.</p>

This <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16phetmasvolden">PhET simulation</a> illustrates another way to determine density, using displacement of water. Determine the density of the red and yellow blocks.</p>
<p id="fs-idp206606992"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>
When you open the density simulation and select Same Mass, you can choose from several 5.00-kg colored blocks that you can drop into a tank containing 100.00 L water. The yellow block floats (it is less dense than water), and the water level rises to 105.00 L. While floating, the yellow block displaces 5.00 L water, an amount equal to the weight of the block. The red block sinks (it is more dense than water, which has density = 1.00 kg/L), and the water level rises to 101.25 L.</p>
<p id="fs-idm85356448">The red block therefore displaces 1.25 L water, an amount equal to the volume of the block. The density of the red block is:</p>

<p id="fs-idm92012848">Note that since the yellow block is not completely submerged, you cannot determine its density from this information. But if you hold the yellow block on the bottom of the tank, the water level rises to 110.00 L, which means that it now displaces 10.00 L water, and its density can be found:</p>

<p id="fs-idm330017088">Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use the SI (International System) or metric systems. We use base SI units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and g/cm<sup>3</sup> (for density). In many cases, we find it convenient to use unit prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> seconds) and megahertz (10<sup>6</sup> hertz), respectively.</p>

<p id="fs-idm288863760">Counting is the only type of measurement that is free from uncertainty, provided the number of objects being counted does not change while the counting process is underway. The result of such a counting measurement is an example of an <span data-type="term">exact number</span>. If we count eggs in a carton, we know <em data-effect="italics">exactly</em> how many eggs the carton contains. The numbers of defined quantities are also exact. By definition, 1 foot is exactly 12 inches, 1 inch is exactly 2.54 centimeters, and 1 gram is exactly 0.001 kilogram. Quantities derived from measurements other than counting, however, are uncertain to varying extents due to practical limitations of the measurement process used.</p>

<p id="fs-idp11446448">The numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, are not exact. To measure the volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point on the curved surface of the liquid.</p>
<figure id="fs-idm337865984"><figcaption>To measure the volume of liquid in this graduated cylinder, you must mentally subdivide the distance between the 21 and 22 mL marks into tenths of a milliliter, and then make a reading (estimate) at the bottom of the meniscus.</figcaption>

<p id="fs-idm176542448">Refer to the illustration in <a href="#fs-idm337865984" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly lies between the 21 and 22 markings, meaning the liquid volume is <em data-effect="italics">certainly</em> greater than 21 mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the 21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquid&#8217;s volume would be 21.6 mL. In the number 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might estimate the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place digit as 5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit to be 7. Note that it would be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In general, numerical scales such as the one on this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the smallest scale division. The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1 mL.</p>
<p id="fs-idm254904560">This concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you place a quarter on a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g. The digits 6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs <em data-effect="italics">about</em> 6.72 grams, with a nominal uncertainty in the measurement of &#177; 0.01 gram. If we weigh the quarter on a more sensitive balance, we may find that its mass is 6.723 g. This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. Every measurement has some <span data-type="term">uncertainty</span>, which depends on the device used (and the user&#8217;s ability). All of the digits in a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called <span data-type="term">significant figures</span> or <span data-type="term">significant digits</span>. Note that zero may be a measured value; for example, if you stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows &#8220;120,&#8221; then the 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.</p>
<p id="fs-idm264880544">Whenever you make a measurement properly, all the digits in the result are significant. But what if you were analyzing a reported value and trying to determine what is significant and what is not? Well, for starters, all nonzero digits are significant, and it is only zeros that require some thought. We will use the terms &#8220;leading,&#8221; &#8220;trailing,&#8221; and &#8220;captive&#8221; for the zeros and will consider how to deal with them.</p>

<p id="fs-idm173917264">When determining significant figures, be sure to pay attention to reported values and think about the measurement and significant figures in terms of what is reasonable or likely when evaluating whether the value makes sense. For example, the official January 2014 census reported the resident population of the US as 317,297,725. Do you think the US population was correctly determined to the reported nine significant figures, that is, to the exact number of people? People are constantly being born, dying, or moving into or out of the country, and assumptions are made to account for the large number of people who are not actually counted. Because of these uncertainties, it might be more reasonable to expect that we know the population to within perhaps a million or so, in which case the population should be reported as 3.17 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mo>&#215;</mo></annotation-xml></semantics></math> 10<sup>8</sup> people.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm191691888"><h1 data-type="title">Significant Figures in Calculations</h1>
<p id="fs-idm277117616">A second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement are at least as uncertain as the measurement itself. We must take the uncertainty in our measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty in calculated results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct number of significant figures, which is determined by the following three rules for <span data-type="term">rounding</span> numbers:</p>
<ol id="fs-idm65809616" data-number-style="arabic">
<li>When we add or subtract numbers, we should round the result to the same number of decimal places as the number with the least number of decimal places (the least precise value in terms of addition and subtraction).</li>
<li>When we multiply or divide numbers, we should round the result to the same number of digits as the number with the least number of significant figures (the least precise value in terms of multiplication and division).</li>
<li>If the digit to be dropped (the one immediately to the right of the digit to be retained) is less than 5, we &#8220;round down&#8221; and leave the retained digit unchanged; if it is more than 5, we &#8220;round up&#8221; and increase the retained digit by 1; if the dropped digit <em data-effect="italics">is</em> 5, we round up or down, whichever yields an even value for the retained digit. (The last part of this rule may strike you as a bit odd, but it&#8217;s based on reliable statistics and is aimed at avoiding any bias when dropping the digit &#8220;5,&#8221; since it is equally close to both possible values of the retained digit.)</li>
</ol>
<p id="fs-idm107335696">The following examples illustrate the application of this rule in rounding a few different numbers to three significant figures:</p>
<ul id="fs-idm192081680" data-bullet-style="bullet">
<li>0.028675 rounds &#8220;up&#8221; to 0.0287 (the dropped digit, 7, is greater than 5)</li>
<li>18.3384 rounds &#8220;down&#8221; to 18.3 (the dropped digit, 3, is lesser than 5)</li>
<li>6.8752 rounds &#8220;up&#8221; to 6.88 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)</li>
<li>92.85 rounds &#8220;down&#8221; to 92.8 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)</li>
</ul>
<p id="fs-idm178562592">Let&#8217;s work through these rules with a few examples.</p>

Measurements are said to be precise if they yield very similar results when repeated in the same manner. A measurement is considered accurate if it yields a result that is very close to the true or accepted value. Precise values agree with each other; accurate values agree with a true value.

<p id="fs-idp108718096">Quantities can be exact or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by the number of significant figures in the measurement. The uncertainty of a calculated value depends on the uncertainties in the values used in the calculation and is reflected in how the value is rounded. Measured values can be accurate (close to the true value) and/or precise (showing little variation when measured repeatedly).</p>

<li>Use dimensional analysis to carry out unit conversions for a given property and computations involving two or more properties</li>
</ul></div>
<p id="fs-idm319461744">It is often the case that a quantity of interest may not be easy (or even possible) to measure directly but instead must be calculated from other directly measured properties and appropriate mathematical relationships. For example, consider measuring the average speed of an athlete running sprints. This is typically accomplished by measuring the <em data-effect="italics">time</em> required for the athlete to run from the starting line to the finish line, and the <em data-effect="italics">distance</em> between these two lines, and then computing <em data-effect="italics">speed</em> from the equation that relates these three properties:</p>

<p id="fs-idm350487392">An Olympic-quality sprinter can run 100 m in approximately 10 s, corresponding to an average speed of</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idm257675424"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mtext>100 m</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>10 s</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mtext>10 m/s</mtext></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mtext>100 m</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>10 s</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>=</mo><mtext>10 m/s</mtext></mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-idm308822992">Note that this simple arithmetic involves dividing the numbers of each measured quantity to yield the number of the computed quantity (100/10 = 10) <em data-effect="italics">and likewise</em> dividing the units of each measured quantity to yield the unit of the computed quantity (m/s = m/s). Now, consider using this same relation to predict the time required for a person running at this speed to travel a distance of 25 m. The same relation between the three properties is used, but in this case, the two quantities provided are a speed (10 m/s) and a distance (25 m). To yield the sought property, time, the equation must be rearranged appropriately:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idm219214640"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext>time</mtext><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>distance</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>speed</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mrow><mtext>time</mtext><mo>=</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mfrac><mrow><mtext>distance</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>speed</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-idm24572080">The time can then be computed as:</p>

<p id="fs-idm316688784">Again, arithmetic on the numbers (25/10 = 2.5) was accompanied by the same arithmetic on the units (m/m/s = s) to yield the number and unit of the result, 2.5 s. Note that, just as for numbers, when a unit is divided by an identical unit (in this case, m/m), the result is &#8220;1&#8221;&#8212;or, as commonly phrased, the units &#8220;cancel.&#8221;</p>
<p id="fs-idp44099792">These calculations are examples of a versatile mathematical approach known as <span data-type="term">dimensional analysis</span> (or the <span data-type="term">factor-label method</span>). Dimensional analysis is based on this premise: <em data-effect="italics">the units of quantities must be subjected to the same mathematical operations as their associated numbers</em>. This method can be applied to computations ranging from simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several different quantities.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm206910464"><h1 data-type="title">Conversion of Temperature Units</h1>
<p id="fs-idm262720192">We use the word <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">temperature</span> to refer to the hotness or coldness of a substance. One way we measure a change in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract when their temperature decreases. The mercury or alcohol in a common glass thermometer changes its volume as the temperature changes. Because the volume of the liquid changes more than the volume of the glass, we can see the liquid expand when it gets warmer and contract when it gets cooler.</p>
<p id="fs-idm308860096">To mark a scale on a thermometer, we need a set of reference values: Two of the most commonly used are the freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, 0 &#176;C is defined as the freezing temperature of water and 100 &#176;C as the boiling temperature of water. The space between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the <span data-type="term">Fahrenheit</span> scale, the freezing point of water is defined as 32 &#176;F and the boiling temperature as 212 &#176;F. The space between these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).</p>
<p id="fs-idm288396336">Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to one another (y = mx). Using familiar length units as one example:</p>
<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="fs-idm6121760"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mtext>length in feet</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mtext>1 ft</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>12 in.</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>&#215;</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>length in inches</mtext></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mrow><mtext>length in feet</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mtext>1 ft</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>12 in.</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mspace width="0.2em"/><mo>&#215;</mo><mspace width="0.2em"/><mtext>length in inches</mtext></mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math></div>
<p id="fs-idm161552768">where y = length in feet, x = length in inches, and the proportionality constant, m, is the conversion factor. The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales, however, do not share a common zero point, and so the relationship between these two scales is a linear one rather than a proportional one (y = mx + b). Consequently, converting a temperature from one of these scales into the other requires more than simple multiplication by a conversion factor, m, it also must take into account differences in the scales&#8217; zero points (b).</p>
<p id="fs-idm292928800">The linear equation relating Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures is easily derived from the two temperatures used to define each scale.

<p id="fs-idm131802496">As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature that can theoretically be achieved. The early 19th-century discovery of the relationship between a gas's volume and temperature suggested that the volume of a gas would be zero at &#8722;273.15 &#176;C. In 1848, British physicist William Thompson, who later adopted the title of Lord Kelvin, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on this concept (further treatment of this topic is provided in this text&#8217;s chapter on gases).</p>

<p id="fs-idm126307616">Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured quantity from one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors, which are derived by simple applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or dimensional analysis. This strategy is also employed to calculate sought quantities using measured quantities and appropriate mathematical relations.</p>

<p id="fs-idm172551024">Your overall health and susceptibility to disease depends upon the complex interaction between your genetic makeup and environmental exposure, with the outcome difficult to predict. Early detection of biomarkers, substances that indicate an organism&#8217;s disease or physiological state, could allow diagnosis and treatment before a condition becomes serious or irreversible. Recent studies have shown that your exhaled breath can contain molecules that may be biomarkers for recent exposure to environmental contaminants or for pathological conditions ranging from asthma to lung cancer. Scientists are working to develop biomarker &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; that could be used to diagnose a specific disease based on the amounts and identities of certain molecules in a patient&#8217;s exhaled breath. An essential concept underlying this goal is that of a molecule&#8217;s identity, which is determined by the numbers and types of atoms it contains, and how they are bonded together. This chapter will describe some of the fundamental chemical principles related to the composition of matter, including those central to the concept of molecular identity.</p>

<p id="fs-idm14647408">The language used in chemistry is seen and heard in many disciplines, ranging from medicine to engineering to forensics to art. The language of chemistry includes its own vocabulary as well as its own form of shorthand. Chemical symbols are used to represent atoms and elements. Chemical formulas depict molecules as well as the composition of compounds. Chemical equations provide information about the quality and quantity of the changes associated with chemical reactions.</p>
<p id="fs-idp133749328">This chapter will lay the foundation for our study of the language of chemistry. The concepts of this foundation include the atomic theory, the composition and mass of an atom, the variability of the composition of isotopes, ion formation, chemical bonds in ionic and covalent compounds, the types of chemical reactions, and the naming of compounds. We will also introduce one of the most powerful tools for organizing chemical knowledge: the periodic table.</p>

<p id="fs-idp22389648">The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers, the scientists of their day. In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite particles that they called <em data-effect="italics">atomos</em>, a term derived from the Greek word for &#8220;indivisible.&#8221; They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four &#8220;elements&#8221;&#8212;fire, earth, air, and water&#8212;and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and &#8220;elements&#8221; as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas.</p>
<p id="fs-idp136823072">The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton&#8217;s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory. Here are the postulates of <span data-type="term">Dalton&#8217;s atomic theory</span>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp64032864">Dalton&#8217;s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that you&#8217;ve learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter).</p>

<p id="fs-idp28034944">Dalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that <em data-effect="italics">all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass</em>. This statement is known as the <span data-type="term">law of definite proportions</span> or the <span data-type="term">law of constant composition</span>. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in <a href="#fs-idp114534448" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp149501712">It is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.</p>
<p id="fs-idp113358288">Dalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The <span data-type="term">law of multiple proportions</span> states that <em data-effect="italics">when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole numbers</em>. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.</p>

<p id="fs-idm8092064">The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed.</p>

<p id="fs-idm28832368">In the two centuries since Dalton developed his ideas, scientists have made significant progress in furthering our understanding of atomic theory. Much of this came from the results of several seminal experiments that revealed the details of the internal structure of atoms. Here, we will discuss some of those key developments, with an emphasis on application of the scientific method, as well as understanding how the experimental evidence was analyzed. While the historical persons and dates behind these experiments can be quite interesting, it is most important to understand the concepts resulting from their work.</p>

<p id="fs-idm48255440">If matter were composed of atoms, what were atoms composed of? Were they the smallest particles, or was there something smaller? In the late 1800s, a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Thomson</span> using a <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">cathode ray</span> tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_02_CathodeRay" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="CNX_Chem_02_02_CathodeRay"><figcaption>(a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

<p id="fs-idm63743520">Based on his observations, here is what Thomson proposed and why: The particles are attracted by positive (+) charges and repelled by negative (&#8722;) charges, so they must be negatively charged (like charges repel and unlike charges attract); they are less massive than atoms and indistinguishable, regardless of the source material, so they must be fundamental, subatomic constituents of all atoms. Although controversial at the time, Thomson&#8217;s idea was gradually accepted, and his cathode ray particle is what we now call an <span data-type="term">electron</span>, a negatively charged, subatomic particle with a mass more than one thousand-times less that of an atom.

Millikan created microscopic oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the charge on individual drops (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_02_Millikan" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp98998624">Scientists had now established that the atom was not indivisible as Dalton had believed, and due to the work of Thomson, Millikan, and others, the charge and mass of the negative, subatomic particles&#8212;the electrons&#8212;were known.

In 1904, Thomson proposed the &#8220;plum pudding&#8221; model of atoms, which described a positively charged mass with an equal amount of negative charge in the form of electrons embedded in it, since all atoms are electrically neutral.

Rutherford and his colleagues Hans <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Geiger</span> (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Marsden</span> aimed a beam of &#945; particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of the radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering of the &#945; particles using a luminescent screen that glowed briefly where hit by an &#945; particle.</p>
<p id="fs-idp56141328">What did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being deflected at all. However, some were diverted slightly, and a very small number were deflected almost straight back toward the source (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_02_Rutherford" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Rutherford described finding these results: &#8220;It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you&#8221;<a data-type="footnote-number" name="footnote-ref1" href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> (p. 68).</p>

<p id="fs-idp11423776">Here is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving &#945; particles passed through the gold atoms undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively charged, so deflections arose when they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since like charges repel one another, the few positively charged &#945; particles that changed paths abruptly must have hit, or closely approached, another body that also had a highly concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred a small fraction of the time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing a series of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:</p>
<ol id="fs-idp55712144" data-number-style="arabic">
<li>The volume occupied by an atom must consist of a large amount of empty space.</li>
<li>A small, relatively heavy, positively charged body, the <span data-type="term">nucleus</span>, must be at the center of each atom.</li>

After many more experiments, Rutherford also discovered that the nuclei of other elements contain the hydrogen nucleus as a &#8220;building block,&#8221; and he named this more fundamental particle the <span data-type="term">proton</span>, the positively charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will learn next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used today.</p>

</div>
<p id="fs-idp40043728">Another important finding was the discovery of isotopes. During the early 1900s, scientists identified several substances that appeared to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a &#8220;new element&#8221; produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the name mesothorium. However, a more detailed analysis showed that mesothorium was chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other elements, led the English chemist Frederick <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Soddy</span> to realize that an element could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically indistinguishable. These different types are called <span data-type="term">isotopes</span>&#8212;atoms of the same element that differ in mass. Soddy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for this discovery.</p>
<p id="fs-idp153048272">One puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom, with the number of protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different proposals were made to explain what constituted the remaining mass, including the existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Chadwick</span> found evidence of <span data-type="term">neutrons</span>, uncharged, subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same as that of protons. The existence of the neutron also explained isotopes: They differ in mass because they have different numbers of neutrons, but they are chemically identical because they have the same number of protons. This will be explained in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

<p id="fs-idp1682080">Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomson&#8217;s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge&#8212;the charge of an electron. Rutherford&#8217;s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. Soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes.</p>

<p id="fs-idp188136384">The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms. It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atom&#8217;s mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom&#8217;s volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10<sup>&#8722;15</sup> m&#8212;about 100,000 times smaller. For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_03_AtomSize" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp27048016">The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its <span data-type="term">atomic number (Z)</span>. This is the defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its <span data-type="term">mass number (A)</span>. The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number: A &#8211; Z = number of neutrons.</p>

<p id="fs-idm159569776">Atoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.

<p id="fs-idm105035264">Traditionally, the discoverer (or discoverers) of a new element names the element. However, until the name is recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the recommended name of the new element is based on the Latin word(s) for its atomic number. For example, element 106 was called unnilhexium (Unh), element 107 was called unnilseptium (Uns), and element 108 was called unniloctium (Uno) for several years. These elements are now named after scientists (or occasionally locations); for example, element 106 is now known as <em data-effect="italics">seaborgium</em> (Sg) in honor of Glenn Seaborg, a Nobel Prize winner who was active in the discovery of several heavy elements.</p>

For instance, <sup>24</sup>Mg is read as &#8220;magnesium 24,&#8221; and can be written as &#8220;magnesium-24&#8221; or &#8220;Mg-24.&#8221; <sup>25</sup>Mg is read as &#8220;magnesium 25,&#8221; and can be written as &#8220;magnesium-25&#8221; or &#8220;Mg-25.&#8221; All magnesium atoms have 12 protons in their nucleus.

<p id="fs-idp64386064">The occurrence and natural abundances of isotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics, medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and help identify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_03_MassSpec" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes the sample&#8217;s atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation&#8217;s path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a <em data-effect="italics">mass spectrum</em>) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modern atomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis in a wide range of applications.</p>

<p id="fs-idm148166800">An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>12</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>12</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math> of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mrow><mo>&#215;</mo></mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math> 10<sup>&#8722;24</sup> g.</p>
<p id="fs-idp228494288">Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1&#8722; and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an atom&#8217;s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.</p>
<p id="fs-idm194069072">Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, two-, or three-letter abbreviations for the atoms.</p>

<p id="fs-idm194401296">A <span data-type="term">molecular formula</span> is a representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule.

<p id="fs-idp69721696">The <span data-type="term">structural formula</span> for a compound gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule. The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_MethaneRep" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The lines represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with atomic sizes not to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the atoms.</p>

<p id="fs-idp191392048">What is it that chemists do? According to Lee <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Cronin</span> (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_LeeCronin" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), chemists make very complicated molecules by &#8220;chopping up&#8221; small molecules and &#8220;reverse engineering&#8221; them. He wonders if we could &#8220;make a really cool universal chemistry set&#8221; by what he calls &#8220;app-ing&#8221; chemistry. Could we &#8220;app&#8221; chemistry?</p>
<p id="fs-idm175319872">In a 2012 TED talk, Lee describes one fascinating possibility: combining a collection of chemical &#8220;inks&#8221; with a 3D printer capable of fabricating a reaction apparatus (tiny test tubes, beakers, and the like) to fashion a &#8220;universal toolkit of chemistry.&#8221; This toolkit could be used to create custom-tailored drugs to fight a new superbug or to &#8220;print&#8221; medicine personally configured to your genetic makeup, environment, and health situation. Says Cronin, &#8220;What Apple did for music, I&#8217;d like to do for the discovery and distribution of prescription drugs.&#8221;<a data-type="footnote-number" name="footnote-ref1" href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> View his <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16LeeCronin">full talk</a> at the TED website.</p>

<p id="fs-idm101901088">It is important to be aware that it may be possible for the same atoms to be arranged in different ways: Compounds with the same molecular formula may have different atom-to-atom bonding and therefore different structures. For example, could there be another compound with the same formula as acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>? And if so, what would be the structure of its molecules?</p>
<p id="fs-idp29766960">If you predict that another compound with the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could exist, then you demonstrated good chemical insight and are correct. Two C atoms, four H atoms, and two O atoms can also be arranged to form a methyl formate, which is used in manufacturing, as an insecticide, and for quick-drying finishes. Methyl formate molecules have one of the oxygen atoms between the two carbon atoms, differing from the arrangement in acetic acid molecules. Acetic acid and methyl formate are examples of <span data-type="term">isomers</span>&#8212;compounds with the same chemical formula but different molecular structures (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_Isomers" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Note that this small difference in the arrangement of the atoms has a major effect on their respective chemical properties. You would certainly not want to use a solution of methyl formate as a substitute for a solution of acetic acid (vinegar) when you make salad dressing.</p>

<p id="fs-idm177313504">Many types of isomers exist (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_04_Isomers2" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).

<p id="fs-idm100378720">A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms.</p>

<p id="fs-idm392133488">As early chemists worked to purify ores and discovered more elements, they realized that various elements could be grouped together by their similar chemical behaviors. One such grouping includes lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K): These elements all are shiny, conduct heat and electricity well, and have similar chemical properties. A second grouping includes calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba), which also are shiny, good conductors of heat and electricity, and have chemical properties in common. However, the specific properties of these two groupings are notably different from each other. For example: Li, Na, and K are much more reactive than are Ca, Sr, and Ba; Li, Na, and K form compounds with oxygen in a ratio of two of their atoms to one oxygen atom, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba form compounds with one of their atoms to one oxygen atom. Fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) also exhibit similar properties to each other, but these properties are drastically different from those of any of the elements above.</p>
<p id="fs-idm421502880">Dimitri <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Mendeleev</span> in Russia (1869) and Lothar <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">Meyer</span> in Germany (1870) independently recognized that there was a periodic relationship among the properties of the elements known at that time. Both published tables with the elements arranged according to increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than Meyer: He used his table to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to aluminum and silicon, but were yet unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and germanium (1886) provided great support for Mendeleev&#8217;s work. Although Mendeleev and Meyer had a long dispute over priority, Mendeleev&#8217;s contributions to the development of the periodic table are now more widely recognized (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_05_Mendeleev" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idm330060208">By the twentieth century, it became apparent that the periodic relationship involved atomic numbers rather than atomic masses. The modern statement of this relationship, the <span data-type="term">periodic law</span>, is as follows: <em data-effect="italics">the properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers</em>. A modern <span data-type="term">periodic table</span> arranges the elements in increasing order of their atomic numbers and groups atoms with similar properties in the same vertical column (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_05_PerTable1" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Each box represents an element and contains its atomic number, symbol, average atomic mass, and (sometimes) name. The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, called <span data-type="term">periods</span> or <span data-type="term">series</span>, and 18 vertical columns, called <span data-type="term">groups</span>. Groups are labeled at the top of each column. In the United States, the labels traditionally were numerals with capital letters. However, IUPAC recommends that the numbers 1 through 18 be used, and these labels are more common. For the table to fit on a single page, parts of two of the rows, a total of 14 columns, are usually written below the main body of the table.</p>

<p id="fs-idm293266416">Many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some elements are similar in their behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are malleable (able to be deformed without breaking) and ductile (can be drawn into wires), and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not shiny, malleable, or ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into large classes with common properties: <span data-type="term">metals</span> (elements that are shiny, malleable, good conductors of heat and electricity&#8212;shaded yellow); <span data-type="term">nonmetals</span> (elements that appear dull, poor conductors of heat and electricity&#8212;shaded green); and <span data-type="term">metalloids</span> (elements that conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and possess some properties of metals and some properties of nonmetals&#8212;shaded purple).</p>
<p id="fs-idm177301632">The elements can also be classified into the <span data-type="term">main-group elements</span> (or <span data-type="term">representative elements</span>) in the columns labeled 1, 2, and 13&#8211;18; the <span data-type="term">transition metals</span> in the columns labeled 3&#8211;12; and <span data-type="term">inner transition metals</span> in the two rows at the bottom of the table (the top-row elements are called <span data-type="term">lanthanides</span> and the bottom-row elements are <span data-type="term">actinides</span>; <a href="#CNX_Chem_02_05_PerTable2" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The elements can be subdivided further by more specific properties, such as the composition of the compounds they form. For example, the elements in group 1 (the first column) form compounds that consist of one atom of the element and one atom of hydrogen. These elements (except hydrogen) are known as <span data-type="term">alkali metals</span>, and they all have similar chemical properties. The elements in group 2 (the second column) form compounds consisting of one atom of the element and two atoms of hydrogen: These are called <span data-type="term">alkaline earth metals</span>, with similar properties among members of that group. Other groups with specific names are the <span data-type="term">pnictogens</span> (group 15), <span data-type="term">chalcogens</span> (group 16), <span data-type="term">halogens</span> (group 17), and the <span data-type="term">noble gases</span> (group 18, also known as <span data-type="term">inert gases</span>). The groups can also be referred to by the first element of the group: For example, the chalcogens can be called the oxygen group or oxygen family. Hydrogen is a unique, nonmetallic element with properties similar to both group 1A and group 7A elements. For that reason, hydrogen may be shown at the top of both groups, or by itself.</p>

<p id="fs-idm382436640">In studying the periodic table, you might have noticed something about the atomic masses of some of the elements. Element 43 (technetium), element 61 (promethium), and most of the elements with atomic number 84 (polonium) and higher have their atomic mass given in square brackets. This is done for elements that consist entirely of unstable, radioactive isotopes (you will learn more about radioactivity in the nuclear chemistry chapter). An average atomic weight cannot be determined for these elements because their radioisotopes may vary significantly in relative abundance, depending on the source, or may not even exist in nature. The number in square brackets is the atomic mass number (and approximate atomic mass) of the most stable isotope of that element.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-idm7568752" class="summary"><h1 data-type="title">Key Concepts and Summary</h1>
<p id="fs-idm431899680">The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition metals. Groups are numbered 1&#8211;18 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals; those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.</p>

<p id="fs-idp207102304">In ordinary chemical reactions, the nucleus of each atom (and thus the identity of the element) remains unchanged. Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from other atoms, lost by transfer to other atoms, or shared with other atoms. The transfer and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements. During the formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically charged particles called ions (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_06_NaCation" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp286908208">You can use the periodic table to predict whether an atom will form an anion or a cation, and you can often predict the charge of the resulting ion. Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them with the same number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali metal (group 1) loses one electron and forms a cation with a 1+ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses two electrons and forms a cation with a 2+ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20 protons and 20 electrons, readily loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and a 2+ charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the preceding noble gas, argon, and is symbolized Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The name of a metal ion is the same as the name of the metal atom from which it forms, so Ca<sup>2+</sup> is called a calcium ion.</p>
<p id="fs-idp20416832">When atoms of nonmetal elements form ions, they generally gain enough electrons to give them the same number of electrons as an atom of the next noble gas in the periodic table. Atoms of group 17 gain one electron and form anions with a 1&#8722; charge; atoms of group 16 gain two electrons and form ions with a 2&#8722; charge, and so on. For example, the neutral bromine atom, with 35 protons and 35 electrons, can gain one electron to provide it with 36 electrons. This results in an anion with 35 protons, 36 electrons, and a 1&#8722; charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the next noble gas, krypton, and is symbolized Br<sup>&#8722;</sup>. (A discussion of the theory supporting the favored status of noble gas electron numbers reflected in these predictive rules for ion formation is provided in a later chapter of this text.)</p>
<p id="fs-idp244942144">Note the usefulness of the periodic table in predicting likely ion formation and charge (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_06_IonCharges" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Moving from the far left to the right on the periodic table, main-group elements tend to form cations with a charge equal to the group number. That is, group 1 elements form 1+ ions; group 2 elements form 2+ ions, and so on. Moving from the far right to the left on the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge equal to the number of groups moved left from the noble gases. For example, group 17 elements (one group left of the noble gases) form 1&#8722; ions; group 16 elements (two groups left) form 2&#8722; ions, and so on. This trend can be used as a guide in many cases, but its predictive value decreases when moving toward the center of the periodic table. In fact, transition metals and some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not predictable by their location in the table. For example, copper can form ions with a 1+ or 2+ charge, and iron can form ions with a 2+ or 3+ charge.</p>

An ion found in some compounds used as antiperspirants contains 13 protons and 10 electrons. What is its symbol?</p>
<p id="fs-idp232924112"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>
Because the number of protons remains unchanged when an atom forms an ion, the atomic number of the element must be 13. Knowing this lets us use the periodic table to identify the element as Al (aluminum). The Al atom has lost three electrons and thus has three more positive charges (13) than it has electrons (10). This is the aluminum cation, Al<sup>3+</sup>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp196671632"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>
Magnesium&#8217;s position in the periodic table (group 2) tells us that it is a metal. Metals form positive ions (cations). A magnesium atom must lose two electrons to have the same number electrons as an atom of the previous noble gas, neon. Thus, a magnesium atom will form a cation with two fewer electrons than protons and a charge of 2+. The symbol for the ion is Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and it is called a magnesium ion.</p>
<p id="fs-idp64788416">Nitrogen&#8217;s position in the periodic table (group 15) reveals that it is a nonmetal. Nonmetals form negative ions (anions). A nitrogen atom must gain three electrons to have the same number of electrons as an atom of the following noble gas, neon. Thus, a nitrogen atom will form an anion with three more electrons than protons and a charge of 3&#8722;. The symbol for the ion is N<sup>3&#8722;</sup>, and it is called a nitride ion.</p>

<p id="fs-idp15116752">When an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an element composed of atoms that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The compound formed by this transfer is stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions of opposite charge present in the compound. For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium metal (group 1) gives up one electron to form a sodium cation, Na<sup>+</sup>, and each chlorine atom in a sample of chlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to form a chloride anion, Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup>, the resulting compound, NaCl, is composed of sodium ions and chloride ions in the ratio of one Na<sup>+</sup> ion for each Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> ion. Similarly, each calcium atom (group 2) can give up two electrons and transfer one to each of two chlorine atoms to form CaCl<sub>2</sub>, which is composed of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> ions in the ratio of one Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion to two Cl<sup>&#8722;</sup> ions.</p>
<p id="fs-idp21794832">A compound that contains ions and is held together by ionic bonds is called an <span data-type="term">ionic compound</span>. The periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic: When a metal is combined with one or more nonmetals, the compound is usually ionic. This guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation for most of the compounds typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not always true (for example, aluminum chloride, AlCl<sub>3</sub>, is not ionic).</p>
<p id="fs-idp56020048">You can often recognize ionic compounds because of their properties. Ionic compounds are solids that typically melt at high temperatures and boil at even higher temperatures. For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 &#176;C and boils at 1413 &#176;C. (As a comparison, the molecular compound water melts at 0 &#176;C and boils at 100 &#176;C.) In solid form, an ionic compound is not electrically conductive because its ions are unable to flow (&#8220;electricity&#8221; is the flow of charged particles). When molten, however, it can conduct electricity because its ions are able to move freely through the liquid (<a href="#CNX_Chem_02_06_NaClMolten" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-idp467312"><span data-type="title">Solution</span>
Because the ionic compound must be electrically neutral, it must have the same number of positive and negative charges. Two aluminum ions, each with a charge of 3+, would give us six positive charges, and three oxide ions, each with a charge of 2&#8722;, would give us six negative charges.

<p id="fs-idp264000688">Many compounds do not contain ions but instead consist solely of discrete, neutral molecules. These <span data-type="term">molecular compounds</span> (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.</p>
<p id="fs-idp207026896">Whereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound&#8217;s elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you&#8217;ll learn more about those later.</p>

<p id="fs-idp122679888">Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and, to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively charged ions are called cations, and negatively charge ions are called anions. Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic (containing more than one atom).</p>
<p id="fs-idp57422256">Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms that behave as a single unit), are called covalent compounds. Covalent compounds usually form from two nonmetals.</p>

<p id="fs-idp268131792">To name an inorganic compound, we need to consider the answers to several questions. First, is the compound ionic or molecular? If the compound is ionic, does the metal form ions of only one type (fixed charge) or more than one type (variable charge)? Are the ions monatomic or polyatomic? If the compound is molecular, does it contain hydrogen? If so, does it also contain oxygen? From the answers we derive, we place the compound in an appropriate category and then name it accordingly.</p>

<p id="fs-idp282354128">Most of the transition metals can form two or more cations with different charges. Compounds of these metals with nonmetals are named with the same method as compounds in the first category, except the charge of the metal ion is specified by a Roman numeral in parentheses after the name of the metal. The charge of the metal ion is determined from the formula of the compound and the charge of the anion. For example, consider binary ionic compounds of iron and chlorine. Iron typically exhibits a charge of either 2+ or 3+ (see <a href="/contents/594923f6-48a5-4824-87b4-2e2cfffddefe@4#CNX_Chem_02_06_IonCharges" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), and the two corresponding compound formulas are FeCl<sub>2</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub>. The simplest name, &#8220;iron chloride,&#8221; will, in this case, be ambiguous, as it does not distinguish between these two compounds. In cases like this, the charge of the metal ion is included as a Roman numeral in parentheses immediately following the metal name. These two compounds are then unambiguously named iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride, respectively. Other examples are provided in <a href="#fs-idp282283328" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

Her investigation eventually linked the illnesses to groundwater contaminated by Cr(VI) used by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) to fight corrosion in a nearby natural gas pipeline. As dramatized in the film <em data-effect="italics">Erin Brokovich</em> (for which Julia Roberts won an Oscar), Erin and lawyer Edward Masry sued PG&amp;E for contaminating the water near Hinckley in 1993.

<p id="fs-idp279149248">Chromium compounds are widely used in industry, such as for chrome plating, in dye-making, as preservatives, and to prevent corrosion in cooling tower water, as occurred near Hinckley. In the environment, chromium exists primarily in either the Cr(III) or Cr(VI) forms. Cr(III), an ingredient of many vitamin and nutritional supplements, forms compounds that are not very soluble in water, and it has low toxicity. But Cr(VI) is much more toxic and forms compounds that are reasonably soluble in water. Exposure to small amounts of Cr(VI) can lead to damage of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, as well as the kidneys, liver, blood, and skin. </p>
<p id="fs-idp279150320">Despite cleanup efforts, Cr(VI) groundwater contamination remains a problem in Hinckley and other locations across the globe. A 2010 study by the Environmental Working Group found that of 35 US cities tested, 31 had higher levels of Cr(VI) in their tap water than the public health goal of 0.02 parts per billion set by the California Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p id="fs-idp268164784">The bonding characteristics of inorganic molecular compounds are different from ionic compounds, and they are named using a different system as well. The charges of cations and anions dictate their ratios in ionic compounds, so specifying the names of the ions provides sufficient information to determine chemical formulas. However, because covalent bonding allows for significant variation in the combination ratios of the atoms in a molecule, the names for molecular compounds must explicitly identify these ratios.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-idp268165696"><h2 data-type="title">Compounds Composed of Two Elements</h2>
<p id="fs-idp268166336">When two nonmetallic elements form a molecular compound, several combination ratios are often possible. For example, carbon and oxygen can form the compounds CO and CO<sub>2</sub>. Since these are different substances with different properties, they cannot both have the same name (they cannot both be called carbon oxide). To deal with this situation, we use a naming method that is somewhat similar to that used for ionic compounds, but with added prefixes to specify the numbers of atoms of each element. The name of the more metallic element (the one farther to the left and/or bottom of the periodic table) is first, followed by the name of the more nonmetallic element (the one farther to the right and/or top) with its ending changed to the suffix &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ide</em>.

The chemistry of these compounds is explored in more detail in later chapters of this text, but for now, it will suffice to note that many acids release hydrogen ions, H<sup>+</sup>, when dissolved in water. To denote this distinct chemical property, a mixture of water with an acid is given a name derived from the compound&#8217;s name. If the compound is a <span data-type="term">binary acid</span> (comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic element):</p>
<ol id="fs-idp282239904" data-number-style="arabic">
<li>The word &#8220;hydrogen&#8221; is changed to the prefix <em data-effect="italics">hydro-</em></li>
<li>The other nonmetallic element name is modified by adding the suffix -<em data-effect="italics">ic</em></li>
<li>The word &#8220;acid&#8221; is added as a second word </li>
</ol>
<p id="fs-idm109568">For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the solution is called <em data-effect="italics">hydrochloric acid</em>. Several other examples of this nomenclature are shown in <a href="#fs-idp272649888" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-idp279162704">Many compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you will learn later. However, we will briefly discuss the important compounds known as <span data-type="term">oxyacids</span>, compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the compound (you will learn the details of this in a later chapter). Typical oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion. To name oxyacids:</p>
<ol id="fs-idp279164064" data-number-style="arabic">
<li>Omit &#8220;hydrogen&#8221;</li>
<li>Start with the root name of the anion</li>
<li>Replace &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ate</em> with &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ic</em>, or &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ite</em> with &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ous</em></li>
<li>Add &#8220;acid&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p id="fs-idp282461232">For example, consider H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (which you might be tempted to call &#8220;hydrogen carbonate&#8221;). To name this correctly, &#8220;hydrogen&#8221; is omitted; the &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ate</em> of carbonate is replace with &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ic</em>; and acid is added&#8212;so its name is carbonic acid. Other examples are given in <a href="#fs-idp268340336" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. There are some exceptions to the general naming method (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is called sulfuric acid, not sulfic acid, and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> is sulfurous, not sulfous, acid).</p>

<p id="fs-idp282340912">Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ide</em>. For example, K<sub>2</sub>O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl<sub>2</sub> is iron(II) chloride and FeCl<sub>3</sub> is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include SF<sub>6</sub>, sulfur hexafluoride, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix <em data-effect="italics">hydro-</em>, changing the &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ide</em> suffix to &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ic</em>, and adding &#8220;acid;&#8221; HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion to &#8211;<em data-effect="italics">ic</em>, and adding &#8220;acid;&#8221; H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is carbonic acid.</p>

<p id="fs-idm37591248">A beekeeper reports that he has 525,341 bees. The last three figures of the number are obviously inaccurate, for during the time the keeper was counting the bees, some of them died and others hatched; this makes it quite difficult to determine the exact number of bees. It would have been more accurate if the beekeeper had reported the number 525,000. In other words, the last three figures are not significant, except to set the position of the decimal point. Their exact values have no meaning useful in this situation. In reporting any information as numbers, use only as many significant figures as the accuracy of the measurement warrants.</p>
<p id="fs-idm308663024">The importance of significant figures lies in their application to fundamental computation. In addition and subtraction, the sum or difference should contain as many digits to the right of the decimal as that in the least certain of the numbers used in the computation (indicated by underscoring in the following example).</p>
