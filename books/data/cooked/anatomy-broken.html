The textbook follows the scope and sequence of most Human Anatomy and Physiology courses, and its coverage and organization were informed by hundreds of instructors who teach the course.  Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.  
The artwork for this textbook is aimed focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.   Color is used sparingly, to emphasize the most important aspects of any given illustration.  Significant use of micrographs from the University of Michigan complement the illustrations, and provide the students with a meaningful alternate depiction of each concept.  Finally, enrichment elements provide relevance and deeper context for students, particularly in the areas of health, disease, and information relevant to their intended careers.</div>

Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.  
</p>
<p id="eip-id1167703115240">Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students&#8217; attention to the critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).

<li>Distinguish between anatomy and physiology, and identify several branches of each</li>
<li>Describe the structure of the body, from simplest to most complex, in terms of the six levels of organization</li>
<li>Identify the functional characteristics of human life</li>
<li>Identify the four requirements for human survival</li>
<li>Define homeostasis and explain its importance to normal human functioning</li>
<li>Use appropriate anatomical terminology to identify key body structures, body regions, and directions in the body</li>
<li>Compare and contrast at least four medical imagining techniques in terms of their function and use in medicine</li>
</ul></div><p id="fs-id2001253">Though you may approach a course in anatomy and physiology strictly as a requirement for your field of study, the knowledge you gain in this course will serve you well in many aspects of your life. An understanding of anatomy and physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can also benefit your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make healthful choices and prompt you to take appropriate action when signs of illness arise. Your knowledge in this field will help you understand news about nutrition, medications, medical devices, and procedures and help you understand genetic or infectious diseases. At some point, everyone will have a problem with some aspect of his or her body and your knowledge can help you to be a better parent, spouse, partner, friend, colleague, or caregiver.</p>
<p id="fs-id2990638">This chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology and a preview of the body regions and functions. It then covers the characteristics of life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions. It introduces a set of standard terms for body structures and for planes and positions in the body that will serve as a foundation for more comprehensive information covered later in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside the living body.</p>

<p id="fs-id2264559">Human <span data-type="term">anatomy</span> is the scientific study of the body&#8217;s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can only be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen, manipulated, measured, and weighed. The word &#8220;anatomy&#8221; comes from a Greek root that means &#8220;to cut apart.&#8221; Human anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a body is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to one another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe structures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow clinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.</p>
<p id="fs-id2608267">Like most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. <span data-type="term">Gross anatomy</span> is the study of the larger structures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>). Macro- means &#8220;large,&#8221; thus, gross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means &#8220;small,&#8221; and <span data-type="term">microscopic anatomy</span> is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification devices (<a href="#fig-ch01_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues. As the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller structures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large molecules in the body.</p><figure id="fig-ch01_01_01"><div data-type="title" class="title">Gross and Microscopic Anatomy</div><figcaption>(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

</figure><p id="fs-id1636111">Anatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body&#8217;s structures: regional and systemic. <span data-type="term">Regional anatomy</span> is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen. Studying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, <span data-type="term">systemic anatomy</span> is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system&#8212;that is, a group of structures that work together to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system would consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.</p>
<p id="fs-id1707081">Whereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human <span data-type="term">physiology</span> is the scientific study of the chemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the functions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body&#8217;s tendency toward homeostasis. <span data-type="term">Homeostasis</span> is the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes observation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However, current advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the functions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.</p>
<p id="fs-id2297149">Like anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology is the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and diverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example, what different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels along nerves).</p>
<p id="fs-id2104406">Form is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear away dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the arrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a smaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific molecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.</p>
<p id="fs-id2080383">Your study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you are studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an understanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the unique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand. Fortunately, your understanding of how the human hand manipulates tools&#8212;from pens to cell phones&#8212;helps you appreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that allows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text messages.</p>

<p id="fs-id2363815">Before you begin to study the different structures and functions of the human body, it is helpful to consider its basic architecture; that is, how its smallest parts are assembled into larger structures. It is convenient to consider the structures of the body in terms of  fundamental levels of organization that increase in complexity: subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms and biosphere (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch01_02_01"><div data-type="title" class="title">Levels of Structural Organization of the Human Body</div><figcaption>The organization of the body often is discussed in terms of six distinct levels of increasing complexity, from the smallest chemical building blocks to a unique human organism.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1371068" data-alt="This illustration shows biological organization as a pyramid. The chemical level is at the apex of the pyramid where atoms bond to form molecules with three dimensional structures. An example is shown with two white hydrogen atoms bonding to a red oxygen atom to create water. The next level down on the pyramid is the cellular level, as illustrated with a long, tapered, smooth muscle cell. At this level, a variety of molecules combine to form the interior fluid and organelles of a body cell. The next level down is the tissue level. A community of similar cells forms body tissue. The example given here is a section of smooth muscle tissue, which contains many smooth muscle cells closely bound side by side. The next level down is the organ level, as illustrated with the bladder and urethra. The bladder contains smooth muscle while the urethra contains skeletal muscle. These are both examples of muscle tissues. The next level down is the organ system level, as illustrated by the entire urinary system containing the kidney, ureters, bladder and urethra. At this level, two or more organs work closely together to perform the functions of a body system. At the base of the pyramid is the organismal level illustrated with a woman drinking water. At this level, many organ systems work harmoniously together to perform the functions of an independent organism.">

</figure><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1688531"><h1 data-type="title">The Levels of Organization</h1><p id="fs-id1250210">To study the chemical level of organization, scientists consider the simplest building blocks of matter: subatomic particles, atoms and molecules. All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances called elements, familiar examples of which are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and iron. The smallest unit of any of these pure substances (elements) is an atom. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles such as the proton, electron and neutron. Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule, such as the water molecules, proteins, and sugars found in living things. Molecules are the chemical building blocks of all body structures.</p><p id="fs-id2348119">A <span data-type="term">cell</span> is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism. Even bacteria, which are extremely small, independently-living organisms, have a cellular structure. Each bacterium is a single cell. All living structures of human anatomy contain cells, and almost all functions of human physiology are performed in cells or are initiated by cells.</p>
<p id="fs-id1641187">A human cell typically consists of flexible membranes that enclose cytoplasm, a water-based cellular fluid together with a variety of tiny functioning units called <span data-type="term">organelles</span>. In humans, as in all organisms, cells perform all functions of life. A <span data-type="term">tissue</span> is a group of many similar cells (though sometimes composed of a few related types) that work together to perform a specific function. An <span data-type="term">organ</span> is an anatomically distinct structure of the body composed of two or more tissue types. Each organ performs one or more specific physiological functions. An <span data-type="term">organ system</span> is a group of organs that work together to perform major functions or meet physiological needs of the body.</p><p id="fs-id2292264">This book covers eleven distinct organ systems in the human body (<a href="#fig-ch01_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> and <a href="#fig-ch01_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Assigning organs to organ systems can be imprecise since organs that &#8220;belong&#8221; to one system can also have functions integral to another system. In fact, most organs contribute to more than one system.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2080383"><h1 data-type="title">Organization</h1>
<p id="fs-id1371870">A human body consists of trillions of cells organized in a way that maintains distinct internal compartments. These compartments keep body cells separated from external environmental threats and keep the cells moist and nourished. They also separate internal body fluids from the countless microorganisms that grow on body surfaces, including the lining of certain tracts, or passageways. The intestinal tract, for example, is home to even more bacteria cells than the total of all human cells in the body, yet these bacteria are outside the body and cannot be allowed to circulate freely inside the body.</p>
<p id="fs-id2352225">Cells, for example, have a cell membrane (also referred to as the plasma membrane) that keeps the intracellular environment&#8212;the fluids and organelles&#8212;separate from the extracellular environment. Blood vessels keep blood inside a closed circulatory system, and nerves and muscles are wrapped in connective tissue sheaths that separate them from surrounding structures. In the chest and abdomen, a variety of internal membranes keep major organs such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys separate from others.</p><p id="fs-id2627627">The body&#8217;s largest organ system is the integumentary system, which includes the skin and its associated structures, such as hair and nails. The surface tissue of skin is a barrier that protects internal structures and fluids from potentially harmful microorganisms and other toxins.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2352228"><h1 data-type="title">Responsiveness</h1>
<p id="fs-id1896316"><span data-type="term">Responsiveness</span> is the ability of an organism to adjust to changes in its internal and external environments. An example of responsiveness to external stimuli could include moving toward sources of food and water and away from perceived dangers. Changes in an organism&#8217;s internal environment, such as increased body temperature, can cause the responses of sweating and the dilation of blood vessels in the skin in order to decrease body temperature, as shown by the runners in <a href="#fig-ch01_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2621560"><h1 data-type="title">Movement</h1>
<p id="fs-id1960688">Human movement includes not only actions at the joints of the body, but also the motion of individual organs and even individual cells. As you read these words, red and white blood cells are moving throughout your body, muscle cells are contracting and relaxing to maintain your posture and to focus your vision, and glands are secreting chemicals to regulate body functions. Your body is coordinating the action of entire muscle groups to enable you to move air into and out of your lungs, to push blood throughout your body, and to propel the food you have eaten through your digestive tract. Consciously, of course, you contract your skeletal muscles to move the bones of your skeleton to get from one place to another (as the runners are doing in <a href="#fig-ch01_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), and to carry out all of the activities of your daily life.</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss the role of oxygen and nutrients in maintaining human survival</li>
<li>Explain why extreme heat and extreme cold threaten human survival</li>
<li>Explain how the pressure exerted by gases and fluids influences human survival</li>
</ul></div>
<p id="fs-id1520530">Humans have been adapting to life on Earth for at least the past 200,000 years. Earth and its atmosphere have provided us with air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, but these are not the only requirements for survival. Although you may rarely think about it, you also cannot live outside of a certain range of temperature and pressure that the surface of our planet and its atmosphere provides. The next sections explore these four requirements of life.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2081426"><h1 data-type="title">Oxygen</h1>
<p id="fs-id2396763">Atmospheric air is only about 20 percent oxygen, but that oxygen is a key component of the chemical reactions that keep the body alive, including the reactions that produce ATP. Brain cells are especially sensitive to lack of oxygen because of their requirement for a high-and-steady production of ATP. Brain damage is likely within five minutes without oxygen, and death is likely within ten minutes.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2395044"><h1 data-type="title">Nutrients</h1>
<p id="fs-id2532130">A <span data-type="term">nutrient</span> is a substance in foods and beverages that is essential to human survival. The three basic classes of nutrients are water, the energy-yielding and body-building nutrients, and the micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).</p>
<p id="fs-id1250210">The most critical nutrient is water. Depending on the environmental temperature and our state of health, we may be able to survive for only a few days without water. The body&#8217;s functional chemicals are dissolved and transported in water, and the chemical reactions of life take place in water. Moreover, water is the largest component of cells, blood, and the fluid between cells, and water makes up about 70 percent of an adult&#8217;s body mass. Water also helps regulate our internal temperature and cushions, protects, and lubricates joints and many other body structures.</p>
<p id="fs-id2269270">The energy-yielding nutrients are primarily carbohydrates and lipids, while proteins mainly supply the amino acids that are the building blocks of the body itself. You ingest these in plant and animal foods and beverages, and the digestive system breaks them down into molecules small enough to be absorbed. The breakdown products of carbohydrates and lipids can then be used in the metabolic processes that convert them to ATP. Although you might feel as if you are starving after missing a single meal, you can survive without consuming the energy-yielding nutrients for at least several weeks.</p>
<p id="fs-id1841065">Water and the energy-yielding nutrients are also referred to as macronutrients because the body needs them in large amounts. In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in many essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also contribute to the body&#8217;s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those reserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as vitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every day or two.</p></section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2352651"><h1 data-type="title">Narrow Range of Temperature</h1>
<p id="fs-id1758474">You have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold. Such deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a narrow range of body temperature, from just below to just above 37&#176;C (98.6&#176;F). When body temperature rises well above or drops well below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal structure and their ability to function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.</p><p id="fs-id1688531">That said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (<a href="#fig-ch01_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) or cold. One of the body&#8217;s responses to heat is, of course, sweating. As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the body, cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so adequate fluid intake is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat response is much less effective in a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the sweat on the skin&#8217;s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_04_01"><div data-type="title" class="title">Extreme Heat</div><figcaption>Humans adapt to some degree to repeated exposure to high temperatures. (credit: McKay Savage/flickr)</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1882111" data-alt="This photo shows two white-clad men riding camels through a sparse desert.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2012017">The body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold. One response to cold is shivering, which is random muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to generate heat. When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop significantly, red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of ATP production. This lack of oxygen can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death. The body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent blood from cooling there and so that the body&#8217;s core can stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains stable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers and toes, can develop frostbite when blood flow to the extremities has been much reduced. This form of tissue damage can be permanent and lead to gangrene, requiring amputation of the affected region.</p>
<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id1977888" class="note anatomy everyday" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Everyday Connection</div>
<p id="fs-id1902785"><span data-type="title">Controlled Hypothermia</span>
As you have learned, the body continuously engages in coordinated physiological processes to maintain a stable temperature. In some cases, however, overriding this system can be useful, or even life-saving. Hypothermia is the clinical term for an abnormally low body temperature (hypo- = &#8220;below&#8221; or &#8220;under&#8221;). Controlled hypothermia is clinically induced hypothermia performed in order to reduce the metabolic rate of an organ or of a person&#8217;s entire body.</p>
<p id="fs-id2471181">Controlled hypothermia often is used, for example, during open-heart surgery because it decreases the metabolic needs of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled hypothermia is used clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to 25&#8211;32&#176;C (79&#8211;89&#176;F). The heart is stopped and an external heart-lung pump maintains circulation to the patient&#8217;s body. The heart is cooled further and is maintained at a temperature below 15&#176;C (60&#176;F) for the duration of the surgery. This very cold temperature helps the heart muscle to tolerate its lack of blood supply during the surgery.</p>
<p id="fs-id2463653">Some emergency department physicians use controlled hypothermia to reduce damage to the heart in patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest. In the emergency department, the physician induces coma and lowers the patient&#8217;s body temperature to approximately 91 degrees. This condition, which is maintained for 24 hours, slows the patient&#8217;s metabolic rate. Because the patient&#8217;s organs require less blood to function, the heart&#8217;s workload is reduced.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1618558"><h1 data-type="title">Narrow Range of Atmospheric Pressure</h1>
<p id="fs-id2567469"><span data-type="term">Pressure</span> is a force exerted by a substance that is in contact with another substance. Atmospheric pressure is pressure exerted by the mixture of gases (primarily nitrogen and oxygen) in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Although you may not perceive it, atmospheric pressure is constantly pressing down on your body. This pressure keeps gases within your body, such as the gaseous nitrogen in body fluids, dissolved. If you were suddenly ejected from a space ship above Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, you would go from a situation of normal pressure to one of very low pressure. The pressure of the nitrogen gas in your blood would be much higher than the pressure of nitrogen in the space surrounding your body. As a result, the nitrogen gas in your blood would expand, forming bubbles that could block blood vessels and even cause cells to break apart.</p>
<p id="fs-id1648023">Atmospheric pressure does more than just keep blood gases dissolved. Your ability to breathe&#8212;that is, to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide&#8212;also depends upon a precise atmospheric pressure. Altitude sickness occurs in part because the atmosphere at high altitudes exerts less pressure, reducing the exchange of these gases, and causing shortness of breath, confusion, headache, lethargy, and nausea. Mountain climbers carry oxygen to reduce the effects of both low oxygen levels and low barometric pressure at higher altitudes (<a href="#fig-ch01_04_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch01_04_02"><div data-type="title" class="title">Harsh Conditions</div><figcaption>Climbers on Mount Everest must accommodate extreme cold, low oxygen levels, and low barometric pressure in an environment hostile to human life.

</figure><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id2227604" class="note anatomy homeostatic" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Homeostatic Imbalances</div>
<p id="fs-id2104133"><span data-type="title">Decompression Sickness</span>
Decompression sickness (DCS) is a condition in which gases dissolved in the blood or in other body tissues are no longer dissolved following a reduction in pressure on the body. This condition affects underwater divers who surface from a deep dive too quickly, and it can affect pilots flying at high altitudes in planes with unpressurized cabins. Divers often call this condition &#8220;the bends,&#8221; a reference to joint pain that is a symptom of DCS.</p>
<p id="fs-id2153756">In all cases, DCS is brought about by a reduction in barometric pressure. At high altitude, barometric pressure is much less than on Earth&#8217;s surface because pressure is produced by the weight of the column of air above the body pressing down on the body. The very great pressures on divers in deep water are likewise from the weight of a column of water pressing down on the body. For divers, DCS occurs at normal barometric pressure (at sea level), but it is brought on by the relatively rapid decrease of pressure as divers rise from the high pressure conditions of deep water to the now low, by comparison, pressure at sea level. Not surprisingly, diving in deep mountain lakes, where barometric pressure at the surface of the lake is less than that at sea level is more likely to result in DCS than diving in water at sea level.</p>
<p id="fs-id1884492">In DCS, gases dissolved in the blood (primarily nitrogen) come rapidly out of solution, forming bubbles in the blood and in other body tissues. This occurs because when pressure of a gas over a liquid is decreased, the amount of gas that can remain dissolved in the liquid also is decreased. It is air pressure that keeps your normal blood gases dissolved in the blood. When pressure is reduced, less gas remains dissolved. You have seen this in effect when you open a carbonated drink. Removing the seal of the bottle reduces the pressure of the gas over the liquid. This in turn causes bubbles as dissolved gases (in this case, carbon dioxide) come out of solution in the liquid.</p>
<p id="fs-id2431360">The most common symptoms of DCS are pain in the joints, with headache and disturbances of vision occurring in 10 percent to 15 percent of cases. Left untreated, very severe DCS can result in death. Immediate treatment is with pure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced, closed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body so that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to the body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing some of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.</p>
</div>
<p id="fs-id2097735">The dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the pressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body tissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the pulsating flow of pressurized blood.</p>

</ul></div>
<p id="eip-991">Maintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body temperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point. A <span data-type="term">set point</span> is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A <span data-type="term">normal range</span> is the restricted set of values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is approximately 37&#176;C (98.6&#176;F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to fluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other parts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. <span data-type="term">Negative feedback</span> is a mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point.  Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters within their normal range.  The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all times, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2568686"><h1 data-type="title">Negative Feedback</h1>
<p id="fs-id2239556">A negative feedback system has three basic components (<a href="#fig-ch01_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>). A <span data-type="term">sensor</span>, also referred to a receptor, is a component of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center. The <span data-type="term">control center</span> is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value deviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. An <span data-type="term">effector</span> is the component in a feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_05_01"><div data-type="title" class="title">Negative Feedback Loop</div><figcaption>In a negative feedback loop, a stimulus&#8212;a deviation from a set point&#8212;is resisted through a physiological process that returns the body to homeostasis.

</span>

</figure><p id="fs-id1291623">In order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that is, beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is &#8220;heard&#8221; by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose, specific endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream. These pancreatic beta cells respond to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose, removing it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in concentration&#8212;the actual negative feedback&#8212;is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This prevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.</p>
<p id="fs-id775958">Humans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat gain (<a href="#fig-ch01_05_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). When the brain&#8217;s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that the body&#8217;s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the &#8220;heat-loss center.&#8221; This stimulation has three major effects:</p>
<ul id="fs-id1221013">
<li>Blood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the skin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.</li>
<li>As blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat evaporates from the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.</li>
<li>The depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the nasal passageways. This further increases heat loss from the lungs.</li></ul>
<p id="fs-id2226448">In contrast, activation of the brain&#8217;s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood returning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins. This arrangement traps heat closer to the body core and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal muscles, causing them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while using up ATP. The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which increases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal glands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which can be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and heat production.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1946828"><h1 data-type="title">Positive Feedback</h1>
<p id="fs-id1408923"><span data-type="term">Positive feedback</span> intensifies a change in the body&#8217;s physiological condition rather than reversing it. A deviation from the normal range results in more change, and the system moves farther away from the normal range. Positive feedback in the body is normal only when there is a definite end point. Childbirth and the body&#8217;s response to blood loss are two examples of positive feedback loops that are normal but are activated only when needed.</p><p id="fs-id2104151">Childbirth at full term is an example of a situation in which the maintenance of the existing body state is not desired. Enormous changes in the mother&#8217;s body are required to expel the baby at the end of pregnancy. And the events of childbirth, once begun, must progress rapidly to a conclusion or the life of the mother and the baby are at risk. The extreme muscular work of labor and delivery are the result of a positive feedback system (<a href="#fig-ch01_05_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig-ch01_05_02"><div data-type="title" class="title">Positive Feedback Loop</div><figcaption>Normal childbirth is driven by a positive feedback loop. A positive feedback loop results in a change in the body&#8217;s status, rather than a return to homeostasis.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2071065" data-alt="This diagram shows the steps of a positive feedback loop as a series of stepwise arrows looping around a diagram of an infant within the uterus of a pregnant woman. Initially the head of the baby pushes against the cervix, transmitting nerve impulses from the cervix to the brain. Next the brain stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete oxytocin which is carried in the bloodstream to the uterus. Finally, the oxytocin simulates uterine contractions and pushes the baby harder into the cervix. As the head of the baby pushes against the cervix with greater and greater force, the uterine contractions grow stronger and more frequent. This mechanism is a positive feedback loop.">

</figure><p id="fs-id2570988">The first contractions of labor (the stimulus) push the baby toward the cervix (the lowest part of the uterus). The cervix contains stretch-sensitive nerve cells that monitor the degree of stretching (the sensors). These nerve cells send messages to the brain, which in turn causes the pituitary gland at the base of the brain to release the hormone oxytocin into the bloodstream. Oxytocin causes stronger contractions of the smooth muscles in of the uterus (the effectors), pushing the baby further down the birth canal. This causes even greater stretching of the cervix. The cycle of stretching, oxytocin release, and increasingly more forceful contractions stops only when the baby is born. At this point, the stretching of the cervix halts, stopping the release of oxytocin.</p>
<p id="fs-id2239774">A second example of positive feedback centers on reversing extreme damage to the body. Following a penetrating wound, the most immediate threat is excessive blood loss. Less blood circulating means reduced blood pressure and reduced perfusion (penetration of blood) to the brain and other vital organs. If perfusion is severely reduced, vital organs will shut down and the person will die. The body responds to this potential catastrophe by releasing substances in the injured blood vessel wall that begin the process of blood clotting. As each step of clotting occurs, it stimulates the release of more clotting substances. This accelerates the processes of clotting and sealing off the damaged area. Clotting is contained in a local area based on the tightly controlled availability of clotting proteins. This is an adaptive, life-saving cascade of events.</p></section>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the anatomical position</li>
<li>Describe the human body using directional and regional terms</li>
<li>Identify three planes most commonly used in the study of anatomy</li>

<p id="fs-id2473278">Anatomists and health care providers use terminology that can be bewildering to the uninitiated. However, the purpose of this language is not to confuse, but rather to increase precision and reduce medical errors. For example, is a scar &#8220;above the wrist&#8221; located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand? Or is it at the base of the hand? Is it on the palm-side or back-side? By using precise anatomical terminology, we eliminate ambiguity. Anatomical terms derive from ancient Greek and Latin words. Because these languages are no longer used in everyday conversation, the meaning of their words does not change.</p>
<p id="fs-id2523539">Anatomical terms are made up of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or condition, whereas the prefix or suffix often describes the root. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix &#8220;hyper-&#8221; means &#8220;high&#8221; or &#8220;over,&#8221; and the root word &#8220;tension&#8221; refers to pressure, so the word &#8220;hypertension&#8221; refers to abnormally high blood pressure.</p><section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1932675"><h1 data-type="title">Anatomical Position</h1>
<p id="fs-id2295576">To further increase precision, anatomists standardize the way in which they view the body. Just as maps are normally oriented with north at the top, the standard body &#8220;map,&#8221; or <span data-type="term">anatomical position</span>, is that of the body standing upright, with the feet at shoulder width and parallel, toes forward. The upper limbs are held out to each side, and the palms of the hands face forward as illustrated in <a href="#fig-ch01_06_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. Using this standard position reduces confusion. It does not matter how the body being described is oriented, the terms are used as if it is in anatomical position. For example, a scar in the &#8220;anterior (front) carpal (wrist) region&#8221; would be present on the palm side of the wrist. The term &#8220;anterior&#8221; would be used even if the hand were palm down on a table.</p>

The <span data-type="term">abdominopelvic cavity</span> is the largest cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the abdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the digestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.</p>

<p id="fs-id2614479">For thousands of years, fear of the dead and legal sanctions limited the ability of anatomists and physicians to study the internal structures of the human body. An inability to control bleeding, infection, and pain made surgeries infrequent, and those that were performed&#8212;such as wound suturing, amputations, tooth and tumor removals, skull drilling, and cesarean births&#8212;did not greatly advance knowledge about internal anatomy. Theories about the function of the body and about disease were therefore largely based on external observations and imagination. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however, the detailed anatomical drawings of Italian artist and anatomist Leonardo da Vinci and Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius were published, and interest in human anatomy began to increase. Medical schools began to teach anatomy using human dissection; although some resorted to grave robbing to obtain corpses. Laws were eventually passed that enabled students to dissect the corpses of criminals and those who donated their bodies for research. Still, it was not until the late nineteenth century that medical researchers discovered non-surgical methods to look inside the living body.</p>

<p id="fs-id2162168">German physicist Wilhelm R&#246;ntgen (1845&#8211;1923) was experimenting with electrical current when he discovered that a mysterious and invisible &#8220;ray&#8221; would pass through his flesh but leave an outline of his bones on a screen coated with a metal compound. In 1895, R&#246;ntgen made the first durable record of the internal parts of a living human: an &#8220;X-ray&#8221; image (as it came to be called) of his wife&#8217;s hand. Scientists around the world quickly began their own experiments with X-rays, and by 1900, X-rays were widely used to detect a variety of injuries and diseases. In 1901, R&#246;ntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize for physics for his work in this field.</p><p id="fs-id1431659">The <span data-type="term">X-ray</span> is a form of high energy electromagnetic radiation with a short wavelength capable of penetrating solids and ionizing gases. As they are used in medicine, X-rays are emitted from an X-ray machine and directed toward a specially treated metallic plate placed behind the patient&#8217;s body. The beam of radiation results in darkening of the X-ray plate. X-rays are slightly impeded by soft tissues, which show up as gray on the X-ray plate, whereas hard tissues, such as bone, largely block the rays, producing a light-toned &#8220;shadow.&#8221; Thus, X-rays are best used to visualize hard body structures such as teeth and bones (<a href="#fig-ch01_07_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Like many forms of high energy radiation, however, X-rays are capable of damaging cells and initiating changes that can lead to cancer. This danger of excessive exposure to X-rays was not fully appreciated for many years after their widespread use.</p><figure id="fig-ch01_07_01"><div data-type="title" class="title">X-Ray of a Hand</div><figcaption>High energy electromagnetic radiation allows the internal structures of the body, such as bones, to be seen in X-rays like these.

In the technique, a patient lies on a motorized platform while a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanner rotates 360 degrees around the patient, taking X-ray images. A computer combines these images into a two-dimensional view of the scanned area, or &#8220;slice.&#8221;</p><figure id="fig-ch01_07_02"><div data-type="title" class="title">Medical Imaging Techniques</div><figcaption>(a) The results of a CT scan of the head are shown as successive transverse sections.

</figure><p id="fs-id1747669">Since 1970, the development of more powerful computers and more sophisticated software has made CT scanning routine for many types of diagnostic evaluations. It is especially useful for soft tissue scanning, such as of the brain and the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to measure the size of a mass down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of radiation many times higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans are at increased risk of developing cancer, as are adults who have multiple CT scans.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id2138801" class="note anatomy interactive" data-label="">

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1364876"><h2 data-type="title">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h2>
<p id="fs-id2523214"><span data-type="term">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</span> is a noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear physics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic fields and radio waves was found to emit radio signals. In 1970, a physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant (cancerous) tissue gave off different signals than normal body tissue. He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device, which was in use clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital computing and electronics led to their advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to discover tumors. MRI also has the major advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.</p>
<p id="fs-id1960262">Drawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI scanner subjects the patient to such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded. The patient must be enclosed in a metal tube-like device for the duration of the scan (see <a href="#fig-ch01_07_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>), sometimes as long as thirty minutes, which can be uncomfortable and impractical for ill patients. The device is also so noisy that, even with earplugs, patients can become anxious or even fearful. These problems have been overcome somewhat with the development of &#8220;open&#8221; MRI scanning, which does not require the patient to be entirely enclosed in the metal tube. Patients with iron-containing metallic implants (internal sutures, some prosthetic devices, and so on) cannot undergo MRI scanning because it can dislodge these implants.</p>
<p id="fs-id2291906">Functional MRIs (fMRIs), which detect the concentration of blood flow in certain parts of the body, are increasingly being used to study the activity in parts of the brain during various body activities. This has helped scientists learn more about the locations of different brain functions and more about brain abnormalities and diseases.</p>

<p id="fs-id2299812"><span data-type="term">Positron emission tomography (PET)</span> is a medical imaging technique involving the use of so-called radiopharmaceuticals, substances that emit radiation that is short-lived and therefore relatively safe to administer to the body. Although the first PET scanner was introduced in 1961, it took 15 more years before radiopharmaceuticals were combined with the technique and revolutionized its potential. The main advantage is that PET (see <a href="#fig-ch01_07_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">c</strong>) can illustrate physiologic activity&#8212;including nutrient metabolism and blood flow&#8212;of the organ or organs being targeted, whereas CT and MRI scans can only show static images. PET is widely used to diagnose a multitude of conditions, such as heart disease, the spread of cancer, certain forms of infection, brain abnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2251902"><h2 data-type="title">Ultrasonography</h2>
<p id="fs-id1277947"><span data-type="term">Ultrasonography</span> is an imaging technique that uses the transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the body to generate an echo signal that is converted by a computer into a real-time image of anatomy and physiology (see <a href="#fig-ch01_07_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">d</strong>). Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in sensitive situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Ultrasonography is used to study heart function, blood flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as gallbladder disease, and fetal growth and development. The main disadvantages of ultrasonography are that the image quality is heavily operator-dependent and that it is unable to penetrate bone and gas.</p>

<p id="fs-id2306133">Human anatomy is the scientific study of the body&#8217;s structures. In the past, anatomy has primarily been studied via observing injuries, and later by the dissection of anatomical structures of cadavers, but in the past century, computer-assisted imaging techniques have allowed clinicians to look inside the living body. Human physiology is the scientific study of the chemistry and physics of the structures of the body. Physiology explains how the structures of the body work together to maintain life. It is difficult to study structure (anatomy) without knowledge of function (physiology). The two disciplines are typically studied together because form and function are closely related in all living things.</p>

Although the body can respond to high temperatures by sweating and to low temperatures by shivering and increased fuel consumption, long-term exposure to extreme heat and cold is not compatible with survival. The body requires a precise atmospheric pressure to maintain its gases in solution and to facilitate respiration&#8212;the intake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide.

<li>Identify the three subatomic particles</li>
<li>Identify the four most abundant elements in the body</li>

</ul></div><p id="fs-id2033651">The smallest, most fundamental material components of the human body are basic chemical elements. In fact, chemicals called nucleotide bases are the foundation of the genetic code with the instructions on how to build and maintain the human body from conception through old age. There are about three billion of these base pairs in human DNA.</p>
<p id="fs-id1478322">Human chemistry includes organic molecules (carbon-based) and biochemicals (those produced by the body). Human chemistry also includes elements. In fact, life cannot exist without many of the elements that are part of the earth. All of the elements that contribute to chemical reactions, to the transformation of energy, and to electrical activity and muscle contraction&#8212;elements that include phosphorus, carbon, sodium, and calcium, to name a few&#8212;originated in stars.</p>
<p id="fs-id1406290">These elements, in turn, can form both the inorganic and organic chemical compounds important to life, including, for example, water, glucose, and proteins. This chapter begins by examining elements and how the structures of atoms, the basic units of matter, determine the characteristics of elements by the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the atoms. The chapter then builds the framework of life from there.</p>

<p id="fs-id2242606">The substance of the universe&#8212;from a grain of sand to a star&#8212;is called <span data-type="term">matter</span>. Scientists define matter as anything that occupies space and has mass. An object&#8217;s mass and its weight are related concepts, but not quite the same. An object&#8217;s mass is the amount of matter contained in the object, and the object&#8217;s mass is the same whether that object is on Earth or in the zero-gravity environment of outer space. An object&#8217;s weight, on the other hand, is its mass as affected by the pull of gravity. Where gravity strongly pulls on an object&#8217;s mass its weight is greater than it is where gravity is less strong. An object of a certain mass weighs less on the moon, for example, than it does on Earth because the gravity of the moon is less than that of Earth. In other words, weight is variable, and is influenced by gravity. A piece of cheese that weighs a pound on Earth weighs only a few ounces on the moon.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2007900"><h1 data-type="title">Elements and Compounds</h1>
<p id="fs-id2052014">All matter in the natural world is composed of one or more of the 92 fundamental substances called elements. An <span data-type="term">element</span> is a pure substance that is distinguished from all other matter by the fact that it cannot be created or broken down by ordinary chemical means. While your body can assemble many of the chemical compounds needed for life from their constituent elements, it cannot make elements. They must come from the environment. A familiar example of an element that you must take in is calcium (Ca<sup>++</sup>). Calcium is essential to the human body; it is absorbed and used for a number of processes, including strengthening bones. When you consume dairy products your digestive system breaks down the food into components small enough to cross into the bloodstream. Among these is calcium, which, because it is an element, cannot be broken down further. The elemental calcium in cheese, therefore, is the same as the calcium that forms your bones. Some other elements you might be familiar with are oxygen, sodium, and iron. The elements in the human body are shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, beginning with the most abundant: oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Each element&#8217;s name can be replaced by a one- or two-letter symbol; you will become familiar with some of these during this course. All the elements in your body are derived from the foods you eat and the air you breathe.</p><figure id="fig-ch02_01_01"><div data-type="title" class="title">Elements of the Human Body </div><figcaption>The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant to least abundant.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2338419" data-alt="This figure shows a human body with the percentage of the main elements in the body, in the left panel.

The number of positively-charged protons and non-charged (&#8220;neutral&#8221;) neutrons, gives mass to the atom, and the number of each in the nucleus of the atom determine the element. The number of negatively-charged electrons that &#8220;spin&#8221; around the nucleus at close to the speed of light equals the number of protons.

Electrons, which have a negative charge, are designated e<sup>&#8211;</sup>. An atom&#8217;s neutrons have no charge: they are electrically neutral. Just as a magnet sticks to a steel refrigerator because their opposite charges attract, the positively charged protons attract the negatively charged electrons. This mutual attraction gives the atom some structural stability. The attraction by the positively charged nucleus helps keep electrons from straying far. The number of protons and electrons within a neutral atom are equal, thus, the atom&#8217;s overall charge is balanced.</p>

<p id="fs-id1962969">An atom of carbon is unique to carbon, but a proton of carbon is not. One proton is the same as another, whether it is found in an atom of carbon, sodium (Na), or iron (Fe). The same is true for neutrons and electrons. So, what gives an element its distinctive properties&#8212;what makes carbon so different from sodium or iron? The answer is the unique quantity of protons each contains. Carbon by definition is an element whose atoms contain six protons. No other element has exactly six protons in its atoms. Moreover, <em data-effect="italics">all</em> atoms of carbon, whether found in your liver or in a lump of coal, contain six protons. Thus, the <span data-type="term">atomic number</span>, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom, identifies the element. Because an atom usually has the same number of electrons as protons, the atomic number identifies the usual number of electrons as well.</p>
<p id="fs-id2673650">In their most common form, many elements also contain the same number of neutrons as protons. The most common form of carbon, for example, has six neutrons as well as six protons, for a total of 12 subatomic particles in its nucleus. An element&#8217;s <span data-type="term">mass number</span> is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. So the most common form of carbon&#8217;s mass number is 12. (Electrons have so little mass that they do not appreciably contribute to the mass of an atom.) Carbon is a relatively light element. Uranium (U), in contrast, has a mass number of 238 and is referred to as a heavy metal. Its atomic number is 92 (it has 92 protons) but it contains 146 neutrons; it has the most mass of all the naturally occurring elements.</p>
<p id="fs-id2364434">The <span data-type="term">periodic table of the elements</span>, shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, is a chart identifying the 92 elements found in nature, as well as several larger, unstable elements discovered experimentally. The elements are arranged in order of their atomic number, with hydrogen and helium at the top of the table, and the more massive elements below. The periodic table is a useful device because for each element, it identifies the chemical symbol, the atomic number, and the mass number, while organizing elements according to their propensity to react with other elements. The number of protons and electrons in an element are equal. The number of protons and neutrons may be equal for some elements, but are not equal for all.</p>

<p id="fs-id2036643">Although each element has a unique number of protons, it can exist as different isotopes. An <span data-type="term">isotope</span> is one of the different forms of an element, distinguished from one another by different numbers of neutrons. The standard isotope of carbon is <sup>12</sup>C, commonly called carbon twelve. <sup>12</sup>C has six protons and six neutrons, for a mass number of twelve. All of the isotopes of carbon have the same number of protons; therefore,<sup> 13</sup>C has seven neutrons, and <sup>14</sup>C has eight neutrons. The different isotopes of an element can also be indicated with the mass number hyphenated (for example, C-12 instead of <sup>12</sup>C). Hydrogen has three common isotopes, shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_01_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id1418017">An isotope that contains more than the usual number of neutrons is referred to as a heavy isotope. An example is <sup>14</sup>C. Heavy isotopes tend to be unstable, and unstable isotopes are radioactive. A <span data-type="term">radioactive isotope</span> is an isotope whose nucleus readily decays, giving off subatomic particles and electromagnetic energy. Different radioactive isotopes (also called radioisotopes) differ in their half-life, the time it takes for half of any size sample of an isotope to decay. For example, the half-life of tritium&#8212;a radioisotope of hydrogen&#8212;is about 12 years, indicating it takes 12 years for half of the tritium nuclei in a sample to decay. Excessive exposure to radioactive isotopes can damage human cells and even cause cancer and birth defects, but when exposure is controlled, some radioactive isotopes can be useful in medicine.

<p id="fs-id1909147"><span data-type="title">Interventional Radiologist</span>
The controlled use of radioisotopes has advanced medical diagnosis and treatment of disease. Interventional radiologists are physicians who treat disease by using minimally invasive techniques involving radiation. Many conditions that could once only be treated with a lengthy and traumatic operation can now be treated non-surgically, reducing the cost, pain, length of hospital stay, and recovery time for patients. For example, in the past, the only options for a patient with one or more tumors in the liver were surgery and chemotherapy (the administration of drugs to treat cancer). Some liver tumors, however, are difficult to access surgically, and others could require the surgeon to remove too much of the liver. Moreover, chemotherapy is highly toxic to the liver, and certain tumors do not respond well to it anyway. In some such cases, an interventional radiologist can treat the tumors by disrupting their blood supply, which they need if they are to continue to grow. In this procedure, called radioembolization, the radiologist accesses the liver with a fine needle, threaded through one of the patient&#8217;s blood vessels. The radiologist then inserts tiny radioactive &#8220;seeds&#8221; into the blood vessels that supply the tumors. In the days and weeks following the procedure, the radiation emitted from the seeds destroys the vessels and directly kills the tumor cells in the vicinity of the treatment.</p>
<p id="fs-id1702647">Radioisotopes emit subatomic particles that can be detected and tracked by imaging technologies. One of the most advanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the activity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The PET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient&#8217;s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the most metabolically active tissues show up as bright &#8220;hot spots&#8221; on the images (<a href="#fig-ch02_01_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). PET can reveal some cancerous masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2059661"><h1 data-type="title">The Behavior of Electrons</h1>
<p id="fs-id1226607">In the human body, atoms do not exist as independent entities. Rather, they are constantly reacting with other atoms to form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must grasp how atoms participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.</p>
<p id="fs-id1391723">Although electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atom&#8217;s nucleus, they do tend to stay within certain regions of space called electron shells. An <span data-type="term">electron shell</span> is a layer of electrons that encircle the nucleus at a distinct energy level.</p><p id="fs-id2603370">The atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells hold eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same for all atoms. The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium have just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice that hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just one electron shell (<a href="#fig-ch02_01_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen and helium.</p>
<p id="fs-id2070158">Lithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third spills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with its six electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two electron shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to neon, have just two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These elements occupy the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_01_06"><div data-type="title" class="title">Electron Shells </div><figcaption>Electrons orbit the atomic nucleus at distinct levels of energy called electron shells. (a) With one electron, hydrogen only half-fills its electron shell. Helium also has a single shell, but its two electrons completely fill it. (b) The electrons of carbon completely fill its first electron shell, but only half-fills its second. (c) Neon, an element that does not occur in the body, has 10 electrons, filling both of its electron shells.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id1256207" data-alt="This four panel figure shows four different atoms with the electrons in orbit around the nucleus.">

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1850994">The factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of electrons in its valence shell. A <span data-type="term">valence shell</span> is an atom&#8217;s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the atom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of other atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in ways that make the valence shell full. Consider hydrogen, with its one electron only half-filling its valence shell. This single electron is likely to be drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen&#8217;s single valence shell can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="fs-id1616535">All atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly eight electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give up, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For example, oxygen, with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the addition of two electrons to oxygen&#8217;s valence shell, bringing the number to eight. When two hydrogen atoms each share their single electron with oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p id="fs-id1890709">In nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways. For example, carbon commonly fills its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements form the simplest of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon-containing compounds on Earth. As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its valence shell. It commonly interacts with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H<sub>2</sub>O. Incidentally, the name &#8220;hydrogen&#8221; reflects its contribution to water (hydro- = &#8220;water&#8221;; -gen = &#8220;maker&#8221;). Thus, hydrogen is the &#8220;water maker.&#8221;</p>

<p id="fs-id2372961">Atoms separated by a great distance cannot link; rather, they must come close enough for the electrons in their valence shells to interact. But do atoms ever actually touch one another? Most physicists would say no, because the negatively charged electrons in their valence shells repel one another. No force within the human body&#8212;or anywhere in the natural world&#8212;is strong enough to overcome this electrical repulsion. So when you read about atoms linking together or colliding, bear in mind that the atoms are not merging in a physical sense.</p>
<p id="fs-id1493624">Instead, atoms link by forming a chemical bond. A <span data-type="term">bond</span> is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in the same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable&#8212;less likely to react again&#8212;than its component atoms were when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds is called a <span data-type="term">molecule</span>. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H<sub>2</sub>, which is called molecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is called a chemical <span data-type="term">compound</span>. Thus, a unit of water, or H<sub>2</sub>O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas methane, or CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p id="fs-id1990227">Three types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are used by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important processes. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2526643"><h1 data-type="title">Ions and Ionic Bonds</h1>
<p id="fs-id2113058">Recall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. As long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical reaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or negatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described previously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away electrons to empty a shell than is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full, valence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge&#8212;whether positive or negative&#8212;is an <span data-type="term">ion</span>.</p><div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id1285208" class="note anatomy interactive" data-label="">

<p id="fs-id2579813">Potassium (K), for instance, is an important element in all body cells. Its atomic number is 19. It has just one electron in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in which it donates one electron. (It is easier for potassium to donate one electron than to gain seven electrons.) The loss will cause the positive charge of potassium&#8217;s protons to be more influential than the negative charge of potassium&#8217;s electrons. In other words, the resulting potassium ion will be slightly positive. A potassium ion is written K<sup>+</sup>, indicating that it has lost a single electron. A positively charged ion is known as a <span data-type="term">cation</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-id2158913">Now consider fluorine (F), a component of bones and teeth. Its atomic number is nine, and it has seven electrons in its valence shell. Thus, it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine accepts one electron (it is easier for fluorine to gain one electron than to donate seven electrons). When it does, its electrons will outnumber its protons by one, and it will have an overall negative charge. The ionized form of fluorine is called fluoride, and is written as F<sup>&#8211;</sup>. A negatively charged ion is known as an <span data-type="term">anion</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-id1405066">Atoms that have more than one electron to donate or accept will end up with stronger positive or negative charges. A cation that has donated two electrons has a net charge of +2. Using magnesium (Mg) as an example, this can be written Mg<sup>++</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. An anion that has accepted two electrons has a net charge of &#8211;2. The ionic form of selenium (Se), for example, is typically written Se<sup>2&#8211;</sup>.</p>
<p id="fs-id1898670">The opposite charges of cations and anions exert a moderately strong mutual attraction that keeps the atoms in close proximity forming an ionic bond. An <span data-type="term">ionic bond</span> is an ongoing, close association between ions of opposite charge. The table salt you sprinkle on your food owes its existence to ionic bonding. As shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, sodium commonly donates an electron to chlorine, becoming the cation Na<sup>+</sup>.

</figure><p id="fs-id2326507">Water is an essential component of life because it is able to break the ionic bonds in salts to free the ions. In fact, in biological fluids, most individual atoms exist as ions. These dissolved ions produce electrical charges within the body. The behavior of these ions produces the tracings of heart and brain function observed as waves on an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) or an electroencephalogram (EEG). The electrical activity that derives from the interactions of the charged ions is why they are also called electrolytes.</p></section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1616095"><h1 data-type="title">Covalent Bonds</h1>
<p id="fs-id2095610">Unlike ionic bonds formed by the attraction between a cation&#8217;s positive charge and an anion&#8217;s negative charge, molecules formed by a <span data-type="term">covalent bond</span> share electrons in a mutually stabilizing relationship. Like next-door neighbors whose kids hang out first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain electrons permanently. Instead, the electrons move back and forth between the elements. Because of the close sharing of pairs of electrons (one electron from each of two atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than ionic bonds.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2002703"><h2 data-type="title">Nonpolar Covalent Bonds</h2>
<p id="fs-id2352651"><a href="#fig-ch02_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows several common types of covalent bonds. Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically share just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is that in covalent bonds, electrons in the outermost valence shell are shared to fill the valence shells of both atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron is shared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms. There even are triple covalent bonds, where three atoms are shared.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id2237662">You can see that the covalent bonds shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> are balanced. The sharing of the negative electrons is relatively equal, as is the electrical pull of the positive protons in the nucleus of the atoms involved. This is why covalently bonded molecules that are electrically balanced in this way are described as nonpolar; that is, no region of the molecule is either more positive or more negative than any other.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1648387"><h2 data-type="title">Polar Covalent Bonds</h2>
<p id="fs-id1909147">Groups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular issue are often described as &#8220;polarized&#8221; by news writers. In chemistry, a <span data-type="term">polar molecule</span> is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical charges. Polar molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.</p>
<p id="fs-id1490078">The most familiar example of a polar molecule is water (<a href="#fig-ch02_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The molecule has three parts: one atom of oxygen, the nucleus of which contains eight protons, and two hydrogen atoms, whose nuclei each contain only one proton. Because every proton exerts an identical positive charge, a nucleus that contains eight protons exerts a charge eight times greater than a nucleus that contains one proton. This means that the negatively charged electrons present in the water molecule are more strongly attracted to the oxygen nucleus than to the hydrogen nuclei. Each hydrogen atom&#8217;s single negative electron therefore migrates toward the oxygen atom, making the oxygen end of their bond slightly more negative than the hydrogen end of their bond.</p>

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2030665">What is true for the bonds is true for the water molecule as a whole; that is, the oxygen region has a slightly negative charge and the regions of the hydrogen atoms have a slightly positive charge. These charges are often referred to as &#8220;partial charges&#8221; because the strength of the charge is less than one full electron, as would occur in an ionic bond. As shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, regions of weak polarity are indicated with the Greek letter delta (&#8706;) and a plus (+) or minus (&#8211;) sign.</p>
<p id="fs-id1278025">Even though a single water molecule is unimaginably tiny, it has mass, and the opposing electrical charges on the molecule pull that mass in such a way that it creates a shape somewhat like a triangular tent (see <a href="#fig-ch02_02_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). This dipole, with the positive charges at one end formed by the hydrogen atoms at the &#8220;bottom&#8221; of the tent and the negative charge at the opposite end (the oxygen atom at the &#8220;top&#8221; of the tent) makes the charged regions highly likely to interact with charged regions of other polar molecules. For human physiology, the resulting bond is one of the most important formed by water&#8212;the hydrogen bond.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2021878"><h1 data-type="title">Hydrogen Bonds</h1>
<p id="fs-id1411843">A <span data-type="term">hydrogen bond</span> is formed when a weakly positive hydrogen atom already bonded to one electronegative atom (for example, the oxygen in the water molecule) is attracted to another electronegative atom from another molecule. In other words, hydrogen bonds always include hydrogen that is already part of a polar molecule.</p>
<p id="fs-id1391982">The most common example of hydrogen bonding in the natural world occurs between molecules of water. It happens before your eyes whenever two raindrops merge into a larger bead, or a creek spills into a river. Hydrogen bonding occurs because the weakly negative oxygen atom in one water molecule is attracted to the weakly positive hydrogen atoms of two other water molecules (<a href="#fig-ch02_02_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p><figure id="fig-ch02_02_04"><div data-type="title" class="title">Hydrogen Bonds between Water Molecules </div><figcaption>Notice that the bonds occur between the weakly positive charge on the hydrogen atoms and the weakly negative charge on the oxygen atoms.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1521728">Water molecules also strongly attract other types of charged molecules as well as ions. This explains why &#8220;table salt,&#8221; for example, actually is a molecule called a &#8220;salt&#8221; in chemistry, which consists of equal numbers of positively-charged sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and negatively-charged chloride (Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>), dissolves so readily in water, in this case forming dipole-ion bonds between the water and the electrically-charged ions (electrolytes). Water molecules also repel molecules with nonpolar covalent bonds, like fats, lipids, and oils. You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen experiment: pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water. Instead of instantly dissolving in the water, the oil forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the nonpolar oil.</p>

<p id="fs-id1473680">One characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go on to maintain that organism&#8217;s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic chemical reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism can proceed in another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules break, releasing smaller molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of energy.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1254361"><h1 data-type="title">The Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions</h1>
<p id="fs-id2033760">Chemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the matter to collide with enough precision and force that old chemical bonds can be broken and new ones formed. In general, <span data-type="term">kinetic energy</span> is the form of energy powering any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one brick atop another is kinetic energy&#8212;the energy matter possesses because of its motion. Once the wall is in place, it stores potential energy. <span data-type="term">Potential energy</span> is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the positioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as kinetic energy as the bricks fall.</p>
<p id="fs-id1384002">In the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. <span data-type="term">Chemical energy</span> is the form of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical energy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released. Notice that chemical energy, like all energy, is neither created nor destroyed; rather, it is converted from one form to another. When you eat an energy bar before heading out the door for a hike, the honey, nuts, and other foods the bar contains are broken down and rearranged by your body into molecules that your muscle cells convert to kinetic energy.</p>
<p id="fs-id1583782">Chemical reactions that release more energy than they absorb are characterized as exergonic. The catabolism of the foods in your energy bar is an example. Some of the chemical energy stored in the bar is absorbed into molecules your body uses for fuel, but some of it is released&#8212;for example, as heat. In contrast, chemical reactions that absorb more energy than they release are endergonic. These reactions require energy input, and the resulting molecule stores not only the chemical energy in the original components, but also the energy that fueled the reaction. Because energy is neither created nor destroyed, where does the energy needed for endergonic reactions come from? In many cases, it comes from exergonic reactions.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2566751"><h1 data-type="title">Forms of Energy Important in Human Functioning</h1>
<p id="fs-id1880539">You have already learned that chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released by chemical bonds. In addition to chemical energy, mechanical, radiant, and electrical energy are important in human functioning.</p>
<ul id="fs-id1637609">
<li>Mechanical energy, which is stored in physical systems such as machines, engines, or the human body, directly powers the movement of matter. When you lift a brick into place on a wall, your muscles provide the mechanical energy that moves the brick.</li>
<li>Radiant energy is energy emitted and transmitted as waves rather than matter. These waves vary in length from long radio waves and microwaves to short gamma waves emitted from decaying atomic nuclei. The full spectrum of radiant energy is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum. The body uses the ultraviolet energy of sunlight to convert a compound in skin cells to vitamin D, which is essential to human functioning. The human eye evolved to see the wavelengths that comprise the colors of the rainbow, from red to violet, so that range in the spectrum is called &#8220;visible light.&#8221;</li>
<li>Electrical energy, supplied by electrolytes in cells and body fluids, contributes to the voltage changes that help transmit impulses in nerve and muscle cells.</li>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2103012"><h1 data-type="title">Characteristics of Chemical Reactions</h1>
<p id="fs-id2081438">All chemical reactions begin with a <span data-type="term">reactant</span>, the general term for the one or more substances that enter into the reaction. Sodium and chloride ions, for example, are the reactants in the production of table salt. The one or more substances produced by a chemical reaction are called the <span data-type="term">product</span>.</p>
<p id="fs-id1383464">In chemical reactions, the components of the reactants&#8212;the elements involved and the number of atoms of each&#8212;are all present in the product(s). Similarly, there is nothing present in the products that are not present in the reactants. This is because chemical reactions are governed by the law of conservation of mass, which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.</p>
<p id="fs-id2177278">Just as you can express mathematical calculations in equations such as 2 + 7 = 9, you can use chemical equations to show how reactants become products. As in math, chemical equations proceed from left to right, but instead of an equal sign, they employ an arrow or arrows indicating the direction in which the chemical reaction proceeds. For example, the chemical reaction in which one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen produce ammonia would be written as <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="left"><semantics><mrow>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1616095"><h1 data-type="title">Factors Influencing the Rate of Chemical Reactions</h1>
<p id="fs-id2654903">If you pour vinegar into baking soda, the reaction is instantaneous; the concoction will bubble and fizz. But many chemical reactions take time. A variety of factors influence the rate of chemical reactions. This section, however, will consider only the most important in human functioning.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2229762"><h2 data-type="title">Properties of the Reactants</h2>
<p id="fs-id1289953">If chemical reactions are to occur quickly, the atoms in the reactants have to have easy access to one another. Thus, the greater the surface area of the reactants, the more readily they will interact. When you pop a cube of cheese into your mouth, you chew it before you swallow it. Among other things, chewing increases the surface area of the food so that digestive chemicals can more easily get at it. As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or solids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have space between their particles. Similarly, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions involving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds, would be expected to proceed faster.</p>
<p id="fs-id2576559">In addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive elements like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements. Reactions involving stable elements like helium are not likely to happen at all.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2327547"><h2 data-type="title">Temperature</h2>
<p id="fs-id1752078">Nearly all chemical reactions occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of matter in motion. The kinetic energy of subatomic particles increases in response to increases in thermal energy. The higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1963075"><h2 data-type="title">Concentration and Pressure</h2>
<p id="fs-id2254825">If just a few people are dancing at a club, they are unlikely to step on each other&#8217;s toes. But as more and more people get up to dance&#8212;especially if the music is fast&#8212;collisions are likely to occur. It is the same with chemical reactions: the more particles present within a given space, the more likely those particles are to bump into one another. This means that chemists can speed up chemical reactions not only by increasing the <span data-type="term">concentration</span> of particles&#8212;the number of particles in the space&#8212;but also by decreasing the volume of the space, which would correspondingly increase the pressure. If there were 100 dancers in that club, and the manager abruptly moved the party to a room half the size, the concentration of the dancers would double in the new space, and the likelihood of collisions would increase accordingly.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2365342"><h2 data-type="title">Enzymes and Other Catalysts</h2>
<p id="fs-id2305458">For two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through random collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their collision. But in the body, extremely high heat&#8212;such as a very high fever&#8212;can damage body cells and be life-threatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that sustain life. That is where catalysts come in.</p>
<p id="fs-id2371267">In chemistry, a <span data-type="term">catalyst</span> is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any change. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which atoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.</p>
<p id="fs-id1855242">The most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An <span data-type="term">enzyme</span> is a catalyst composed of protein or ribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction&#8217;s <span data-type="term">activation energy</span> is the &#8220;threshold&#8221; level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken, new arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed to ignite a chemical reaction (<a href="#fig-ch02_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_03_02"><div data-type="title" class="title">Enzymes </div><figcaption>Enzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur.

</figure><p id="fs-id2151113">Enzymes are critical to the body&#8217;s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its conversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.</p>

<p id="fs-id1618560">The concepts you have learned so far in this chapter govern all forms of matter, and would work as a foundation for geology as well as biology. This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the compounds important for the body&#8217;s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or organic.</p>
<ul id="fs-id2095610"><li>An<span data-type="term"> inorganic compound</span> is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many inorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl) produced by your stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the few examples.</li>
<li>An<span data-type="term"> organic compound</span>, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are synthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and hydrogen are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two elements combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the chemicals that fuel your functioning.</li>
</ul><p id="fs-id1617787">The following section examines the three groups of inorganic compounds essential to life: water, salts, acids, and bases. Organic compounds are covered later in the chapter.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2277949"><h1 data-type="title">Water</h1>
<p id="fs-id1893156">As much as 70 percent of an adult&#8217;s body weight is water. This water is contained both within the cells and between the cells that make up tissues and organs. Its several roles make water indispensable to human functioning.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1632890"><h2 data-type="title">Water as a Lubricant and Cushion</h2>
<p id="fs-id2364434">Water is a major component of many of the body&#8217;s lubricating fluids. Just as oil lubricates the hinge on a door, water in synovial fluid lubricates the actions of body joints, and water in pleural fluid helps the lungs expand and recoil with breathing. Watery fluids help keep food flowing through the digestive tract, and ensure that the movement of adjacent abdominal organs is friction free.</p>
<p id="fs-id1976429">Water also protects cells and organs from physical trauma, cushioning the brain within the skull, for example, and protecting the delicate nerve tissue of the eyes. Water cushions a developing fetus in the mother&#8217;s womb as well.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1702647"><h2 data-type="title">Water as a Heat Sink</h2>
<p id="fs-id1616535">A heat sink is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding increase in temperature. In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly increasing in temperature. Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps keep the body cool. This cooling effect happens as warm blood from the body&#8217;s core flows to the blood vessels just under the skin and is transferred to the environment. At the same time, sweat glands release warm water in sweat. As the water evaporates into the air, it carries away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates back to the body core.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2305458"><h2 data-type="title">Water as a Component of Liquid Mixtures</h2>
<p id="fs-id2157424">A mixture is a combination of two or more substances, each of which maintains its own chemical identity. In other words, the constituent substances are not chemically bonded into a new, larger chemical compound. The concept is easy to imagine if you think of powdery substances such as flour and sugar; when you stir them together in a bowl, they obviously do not bond to form a new compound. The room air you breathe is a gaseous mixture, containing three discrete elements&#8212;nitrogen, oxygen, and argon&#8212;and one compound, carbon dioxide. There are three types of liquid mixtures, all of which contain water as a key component. These are solutions, colloids, and suspensions.</p>
<p id="fs-id1856926">For cells in the body to survive, they must be kept moist in a water-based liquid called a solution. In chemistry, a liquid <span data-type="term">solution</span> consists of a solvent that dissolves a substance called a solute. An important characteristic of solutions is that they are homogeneous; that is, the solute molecules are distributed evenly throughout the solution. If you were to stir a teaspoon of sugar into a glass of water, the sugar would dissolve into sugar molecules separated by water molecules. The ratio of sugar to water in the left side of the glass would be the same as the ratio of sugar to water in the right side of the glass. If you were to add more sugar, the ratio of sugar to water would change, but the distribution&#8212;provided you had stirred well&#8212;would still be even.</p>
<p id="fs-id2065630">Water is considered the &#8220;universal solvent&#8221; and it is believed that life cannot exist without water because of this. Water is certainly the most abundant solvent in the body; essentially all of the body&#8217;s chemical reactions occur among compounds dissolved in water. Because water molecules are polar, with regions of positive and negative electrical charge, water readily dissolves ionic compounds and polar covalent compounds. Such compounds are referred to as hydrophilic, or &#8220;water-loving.&#8221; As mentioned above, sugar dissolves well in water. This is because sugar molecules contain regions of hydrogen-oxygen polar bonds, making it hydrophilic. Nonpolar molecules, which do not readily dissolve in water, are called hydrophobic, or &#8220;water-fearing.&#8221;</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1917666"><h2 data-type="title">Concentrations of Solutes</h2>
<p id="fs-id1218107">Various mixtures of solutes and water are described in chemistry. The concentration of a given solute is the number of particles of that solute in a given space (oxygen makes up about 21 percent of atmospheric air). In the bloodstream of humans, glucose concentration is usually measured in milligram (mg) per deciliter (dL), and in a healthy adult averages about 100 mg/dL. Another method of measuring the concentration of a solute is by its molarilty&#8212;which is moles (M) of the molecules per liter (L). The mole of an element is its atomic weight, while a mole of a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of its components, called the molecular weight. An often-used example is calculating a mole of glucose, with the chemical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. Using the periodic table, the atomic weight of carbon (C) is 12.011 grams (g), and there are six carbons in glucose, for a total atomic weight of 72.066 g. Doing the same calculations for hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), the molecular weight equals 180.156g (the &#8220;gram molecular weight&#8221; of glucose). When water is added to make one liter of solution, you have one mole (1M) of glucose. This is particularly useful in chemistry because of the relationship of moles to &#8220;Avogadro&#8217;s number.&#8221; A mole of any solution has the same number of particles in it: 6.02 &#215; 10<sup>23</sup>. Many substances in the bloodstream and other tissue of the body are measured in thousandths of a mole, or millimoles (mM).</p>
<p id="fs-id1960900">A <span data-type="term">colloid</span> is a mixture that is somewhat like a heavy solution. The solute particles consist of tiny clumps of molecules large enough to make the liquid mixture opaque (because the particles are large enough to scatter light). Familiar examples of colloids are milk and cream. In the thyroid glands, the thyroid hormone is stored as a thick protein mixture also called a colloid.</p>
<p id="fs-id2328232">A <span data-type="term">suspension</span> is a liquid mixture in which a heavier substance is suspended temporarily in a liquid, but over time, settles out. This separation of particles from a suspension is called sedimentation. An example of sedimentation occurs in the blood test that establishes sedimentation rate, or sed rate. The test measures how quickly red blood cells in a test tube settle out of the watery portion of blood (known as plasma) over a set period of time. Rapid sedimentation of blood cells does not normally happen in the healthy body, but aspects of certain diseases can cause blood cells to clump together, and these heavy clumps of blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube more quickly than do normal blood cells.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2202854"><h2 data-type="title">The Role of Water in Chemical Reactions</h2>
<p id="fs-id1368540">Two types of chemical reactions involve the creation or the consumption of water: dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis.</p>
<ul id="fs-id2175979">
<li>In dehydration synthesis, one reactant gives up an atom of hydrogen and another reactant gives up a hydroxyl group (OH) in the synthesis of a new product. In the formation of their covalent bond, a molecule of water is released as a byproduct (<a href="#fig-ch02_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This is also sometimes referred to as a condensation reaction.</li>
<li>In hydrolysis, a molecule of water disrupts a compound, breaking its bonds. The water is itself split into H and OH. One portion of the severed compound then bonds with the hydrogen atom, and the other portion bonds with the hydroxyl group.</li></ul>
<p id="fs-id1433631">These reactions are reversible, and play an important role in the chemistry of organic compounds (which will be discussed shortly).</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_04_01"><div data-type="title" class="title">Dehydration Synthesis and Hydrolysis </div><figcaption>Monomers, the basic units for building larger molecules, form polymers (two or more chemically-bonded monomers). (a) In dehydration synthesis, two monomers are covalently bonded in a reaction in which one gives up a hydroxyl group and the other a hydrogen atom.

(b) In hydrolysis, the covalent bond between two monomers is split by the addition of a hydrogen atom to one and a hydroxyl group to the other, which requires the contribution of one molecule of water.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2065416" data-alt="The top panel in this figure shows a dehydration-synthesis reaction, and the bottom panel shows a hydrolysis reaction.">

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id2068483"><h1 data-type="title">Salts</h1>
<p id="fs-id1425179">Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next.</p>
<p id="fs-id2103101">A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (<a href="#fig-ch02_04_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The positive and negative regions on the water molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_04_02"><div data-type="title" class="title">Dissociation of Sodium Chloride in Water </div><figcaption>Notice that the crystals of sodium chloride dissociate not into molecules of NaCl, but into Na<sup>+</sup> cations and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> anions, each completely surrounded by water molecules.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2024162" data-alt="This figure shows a crystal lattice of sodium chloride interacting with water to form a hydrated sodium ion and a hydrated chloride ion.">

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1866078">Many other salts are important in the body. For example, bile salts produced by the liver help break apart dietary fats, and calcium phosphate salts form the mineral portion of teeth and bones.</p>
</section>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1748153"><h1 data-type="title">Acids and Bases</h1>
<p id="fs-id1417972">Acids and bases, like salts, dissociate in water into electrolytes. Acids and bases can very much change the properties of the solutions in which they are dissolved.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1751608"><h2 data-type="title">Acids</h2>
<p id="fs-id1938324">An <span data-type="term">acid</span> is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in solution (<a href="#fig-ch02_04_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>). Because an atom of hydrogen has just one proton and one electron, a positively charged hydrogen ion is simply a proton. This solitary proton is highly likely to participate in chemical reactions. Strong acids are compounds that release all of their H<sup>+ </sup>in solution; that is, they ionize completely. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from cells in the lining of the stomach, is a strong acid because it releases all of its H<sup>+ </sup>in the stomach&#8217;s watery environment. This strong acid aids in digestion and kills ingested microbes. Weak acids do not ionize completely; that is, some of their hydrogen<sup> </sup>ions<sup> </sup>remain bonded within a compound in solution. An example of a weak acid is vinegar, or acetic acid; it is called acetate after it gives up a proton.</p>

<p id="fs-id1250576">A <span data-type="term">base</span> is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>) in solution, or one that accepts H<sup>+</sup> already present in solution (see <a href="#fig-ch02_04_03" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine with H<sup>+ </sup>present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H<sup>+</sup> and reducing the solution&#8217;s acidity. Strong bases release most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H<sup>+</sup>. Food mixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract after the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>), a weak base that attracts H<sup>+</sup>. Bicarbonate accepts some of the H<sup>+</sup> protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.</p></section>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1902812"><h2 data-type="title">The Concept of pH</h2>
<p id="fs-id1358455">The relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution&#8217;s <span data-type="term">pH</span> is the negative, base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H<sup>+</sup> concentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH scale, like that shown in <a href="#fig-ch02_04_04" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution with a pH of 7 is considered neutral&#8212;neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below 7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H<sup>+</sup>. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each pH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10<sup>&#8211;4</sup> M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10<sup>&#8211;5</sup> M, or 0.00001M. The higher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H<sup>+</sup>. Human urine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1492348"><h2 data-type="title">Buffers</h2><p id="fs-id2061621">The pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this slightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) constantly being released into the bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO<sub>2</sub> while breathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations&#8212;either too acidic or too alkaline&#8212;can lead to life-threatening disorders.</p>
<p id="fs-id1282302">All cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid&#8211;base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body therefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and the internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A <span data-type="term">buffer</span> is a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is even a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid&#8212;in this case, acting as a weak base&#8212;will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and contribute hydrogen ions.</p>
<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="fs-id2072379" class="note anatomy homeostatic" data-label=""><div data-type="title" class="title">Homeostatic Imbalances</div>
<p id="fs-id1224632"><span data-type="title">Acids and Bases</span>
Excessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations and disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person&#8217;s ability to exhale fully, which causes a buildup of CO<sub>2</sub> (and H<sup>+</sup>) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the level or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe diarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with poorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of body fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.</p>
<p id="fs-id1897513">In contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with acidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low. Lung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the normal concentration of H<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p id="fs-id2285357">Metabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride ions (as components of HCl). Medications also can prompt alkalosis. These include diuretics that cause the body to lose potassium ions, as well as antacids when taken in excessive amounts, for instance by someone with persistent heartburn or an ulcer.</p>

<p id="fs-id1857113">Organic compounds typically consist of groups of carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, usually oxygen, and often other elements as well. Created by living things, they are found throughout the world, in soils and seas, commercial products, and every cell of the human body. The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of carbon.</p>
<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1243123"><h1 data-type="title">The Chemistry of Carbon</h1>
<p id="fs-id2413719">What makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four electrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to complete their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or accepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.</p>
<p id="fs-id2338170">Commonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon skeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather, carbon atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and hydrogen groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this chapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.</p>
<p id="fs-id2069935">Many combinations are possible to fill carbon&#8217;s four &#8220;vacancies.&#8221; Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or nitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound. Moreover, the atoms to which carbon atoms bond may also be part of a functional group. A <span data-type="term">functional group</span> is a group of atoms linked by strong covalent bonds and tending to function in chemical reactions as a single unit. You can think of functional groups as tightly knit &#8220;cliques&#8221; whose members are unlikely to be parted. Five functional groups are important in human physiology; these are the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, methyl and phosphate groups (<a href="#tbl-ch02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>

<p id="fs-id1383422">Carbon&#8217;s affinity for covalent bonding means that many distinct and relatively stable organic molecules nevertheless readily form larger, more complex molecules. Any large molecule is referred to as <span data-type="term">macromolecule</span> (macro- = &#8220;large&#8221;), and the organic compounds in this section all fit this description. However, some macromolecules are made up of several &#8220;copies&#8221; of single units called monomer (mono- = &#8220;one&#8221;; -mer = &#8220;part&#8221;). Like beads in a long necklace, these monomers link by covalent bonds to form long polymers (poly- = &#8220;many&#8221;). There are many examples of monomers and polymers among the organic compounds.</p>
<p id="fs-id2664476">Monomers form polymers by engaging in dehydration synthesis (see <a href="/contents/e4e45509-bfc0-4aee-b73e-17b7582bf7e1#fig-ch02_04_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). As was noted earlier, this reaction results in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the other gives up a hydroxyl group. Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = &#8220;rupture&#8221;). The bonds between their monomers are broken, via the donation of a molecule of water, which contributes a hydrogen atom to one monomer and a hydroxyl group to the other.</p></section>

Butter and lard are examples, as is the fat found on a steak or in your own body. In contrast, fatty acids with one double carbon bond are kinked at that bond (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_05" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). These monounsaturated fatty acids are therefore unable to pack together tightly, and are liquid at room temperature. Polyunsaturated fatty acids contain two or more double carbon bonds, and are also liquid at room temperature. Plant oils such as olive oil typically contain both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>

</figure><p id="fs-id2122578">Whereas a diet high in saturated fatty acids increases the risk of heart disease, a diet high in unsaturated fatty acids is thought to reduce the risk. This is especially true for the omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids found in cold-water fish such as salmon. These fatty acids have their first double carbon bond at the third hydrocarbon from the methyl group (referred to as the omega end of the molecule).</p>
<p id="fs-id805451">Finally, <em data-effect="italics">trans</em> fatty acids found in some processed foods, including some stick and tub margarines, are thought to be even more harmful to the heart and blood vessels than saturated fatty acids. <em data-effect="italics">Trans</em> fats are created from unsaturated fatty acids (such as corn oil) when chemically treated to produce partially hydrogenated fats.</p>
<p id="fs-id2339167">As a group, triglycerides are a major fuel source for the body. When you are resting or asleep, a majority of the energy used to keep you alive is derived from triglycerides stored in your fat (adipose) tissues. Triglycerides also fuel long, slow physical activity such as gardening or hiking, and contribute a modest percentage of energy for vigorous physical activity. Dietary fat also assists the absorption and transport of the nonpolar fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Additionally, stored body fat protects and cushions the body&#8217;s bones and internal organs, and acts as insulation to retain body heat.</p>

<p id="fs-id1956733">As its name suggests, a <span data-type="term">phospholipid</span> is a bond between the glycerol component of a lipid and a phosphorous molecule. In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_06" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The third binding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar &#8220;head&#8221; region of the molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as on the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to have hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate groups and nitrogen atom.</p><figure id="fig-ch02_05_06"><div data-type="title" class="title">Other Important Lipids </div><figcaption>(a) Phospholipids are composed of two fatty acids, glycerol, and a phosphate group.

Although both plants and animals synthesize sterols, the type that makes the most important contribution to human structure and function is cholesterol, which is synthesized by the liver in humans and animals and is also present in most animal-based foods. Like other lipids, cholesterol&#8217;s hydrocarbons make it hydrophobic; however, it has a polar hydroxyl head that is hydrophilic. Cholesterol is an important component of bile acids, compounds that help emulsify dietary fats. In fact, the word root chole- refers to bile. Cholesterol is also a building block of many hormones, signaling molecules that the body releases to regulate processes at distant sites. Finally, like phospholipids, cholesterol molecules are found in the cell membrane, where their hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions help regulate the flow of substances into and out of the cell.</p>

<p id="fs-id2271940">You might associate proteins with muscle tissue, but in fact, proteins are critical components of all tissues and organs. A <span data-type="term">protein</span> is an organic molecule composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Proteins include the keratin in the epidermis of skin that protects underlying tissues, the collagen found in the dermis of skin, in bones, and in the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord. Proteins are also components of many of the body&#8217;s functional chemicals, including digestive enzymes in the digestive tract, antibodies, the neurotransmitters that neurons use to communicate with other cells, and the peptide-based hormones that regulate certain body functions (for instance, growth hormone). While carbohydrates and lipids are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygen, all proteins also contain nitrogen (N), and many contain sulfur (S), in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>
<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2102448"><h2 data-type="title">Microstructure of Proteins</h2>
<p id="fs-id2151470">Proteins are polymers made up of nitrogen-containing monomers called amino acids. An <span data-type="term">amino acid</span> is a molecule composed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids contribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body proteins contain a unique combination of a few dozen to a few hundred of these 20 amino acid monomers. All 20 of these amino acids share a similar structure (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_07" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). All consist of a central carbon atom to which the following are bonded:</p>
<ul id="fs-id2237954">
<li>a hydrogen atom</li>
<li>an alkaline (basic) amino group NH<sub>2</sub> (see <a href="#tbl-ch02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>)</li>

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1698290">Notice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine = &#8220;nitrogen-containing&#8221;). For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid&#8211;base balance. What distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain or an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique characteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids&#8212;cysteine and methionine&#8212;contain sulfur. Sulfur does not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way that proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.</p>
<p id="fs-id1700797">Amino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_08" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The unique bond holding amino acids together is called a peptide bond. A <span data-type="term">peptide bond</span> is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by dehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about 100 amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.</p>

<p id="fs-id1470071">Just as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein&#8217;s shape is essential to its function. A protein&#8217;s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is made (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">a</strong>). The sequence is called the primary structure of the protein.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_05_09"><div data-type="title" class="title">The Shape of Proteins </div><figcaption>(a) The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. (b) The secondary structure, which can take the form of an alpha-helix or a beta-pleated sheet, is maintained by hydrogen bonds between amino acids in different regions of the original polypeptide strand. (c) The tertiary structure occurs as a result of further folding and bonding of the secondary structure. (d) The quaternary structure occurs as a result of interactions between two or more tertiary subunits. The example shown here is hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen to body tissues.</figcaption><span data-type="media" id="fs-id2623329" data-alt="This figure shows the secondary structure of peptides.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id2242372">Although some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary structures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the polypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">b</strong>). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.</p>
<p id="fs-id1707170">The secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein&#8217;s tertiary structure (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">c</strong>). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. A<span data-type="term"> disulfide bond</span> is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">d</strong>). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains.</p>
<p id="fs-id1840952">When they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. <span data-type="term">Denaturation</span> is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added.</p>
<p id="fs-id2625066">The contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. For example, the long, slender shape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax (lengthen). As another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding upon which bone minerals are deposited. These elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable and typically hydrophobic.</p>
<p id="fs-id1383766">In contrast, globular proteins are globes or spheres that tend to be highly reactive and are hydrophilic. The hemoglobin proteins packed into red blood cells are an example (see <a href="#fig-ch02_05_09" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong data-effect="bold">d</strong>); however, globular proteins are abundant throughout the body, playing critical roles in most body functions. Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein catalysts, are examples of this. The next section takes a closer look at the action of enzymes.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id2350637"><h2 data-type="title">Proteins Function as Enzymes</h2>
<p id="fs-id2591372">If you were trying to type a paper, and every time you hit a key on your laptop there was a delay of six or seven minutes before you got a response, you would probably get a new laptop. In a similar way, without enzymes to catalyze chemical reactions, the human body would be nonfunctional. It functions only because enzymes function.</p>
<p id="fs-id1861297">Enzymatic reactions&#8212;chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes&#8212;begin when substrates bind to the enzyme. A <span data-type="term">substrate</span> is a reactant in an enzymatic reaction. This occurs on regions of the enzyme known as active sites (<a href="#fig-ch02_05_10" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Any given enzyme catalyzes just one type of chemical reaction. This characteristic, called specificity, is due to the fact that a substrate with a particular shape and electrical charge can bind only to an active site corresponding to that substrate.</p>
<figure id="fig-ch02_05_10"><div data-type="title" class="title">Steps in an Enzymatic Reaction </div><figcaption>(a) Substrates approach active sites on enzyme.

</span>
</figure><p id="fs-id1645297">Binding of a substrate produces an enzyme&#8211;substrate complex. It is likely that enzymes speed up chemical reactions in part because the enzyme&#8211;substrate complex undergoes a set of temporary and reversible changes that cause the substrates to be oriented toward each other in an optimal position to facilitate their interaction. This promotes increased reaction speed. The enzyme then releases the product(s), and resumes its original shape. The enzyme is then free to engage in the process again, and will do so as long as substrate remains.</p>

<p id="fs-id2370050">Advertisements for protein bars, powders, and shakes all say that protein is important in building, repairing, and maintaining muscle tissue, but the truth is that proteins contribute to all body tissues, from the skin to the brain cells. Also, certain proteins act as hormones, chemical messengers that help regulate body functions, For example, growth hormone is important for skeletal growth, among other roles.</p><p id="fs-id2154528">As was noted earlier, the basic and acidic components enable proteins to function as buffers in maintaining acid&#8211;base balance, but they also help regulate fluid&#8211;electrolyte balance. Proteins attract fluid, and a healthy concentration of proteins in the blood, the cells, and the spaces between cells helps ensure a balance of fluids in these various &#8220;compartments.&#8221; Moreover, proteins in the cell membrane help to transport electrolytes in and out of the cell, keeping these ions in a healthy balance. Like lipids, proteins can bind with carbohydrates. They can thereby produce glycoproteins or proteoglycans, both of which have many functions in the body.</p>
<p id="fs-id2070161">The body can use proteins for energy when carbohydrate and fat intake is inadequate, and stores of glycogen and adipose tissue become depleted. However, since there is no storage site for protein except functional tissues, using protein for energy causes tissue breakdown, and results in body wasting.</p>

In such cases, the same level of energy that had been released during hydrolysis must be reinvested to power dehydration synthesis.</p>
<p id="fs-id1840762">Cells can also transfer a phosphate group from ATP to another organic compound. For example, when glucose first enters a cell, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP, forming glucose phosphate (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>&#8212;P) and ADP. Once glucose is phosphorylated in this way, it can be stored as glycogen or metabolized for immediate energy.</p>

<p id="fs-id2622904">The human body is composed of elements, the most abundant of which are oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N). You obtain these elements from the foods you eat and the air you breathe. The smallest unit of an element that retains all of the properties of that element is an atom. But, atoms themselves contain many subatomic particles, the three most important of which are protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles do not vary in quality from one element to another; rather, what gives an element its distinctive identification is the quantity of its protons, called its atomic number. Protons and neutrons contribute nearly all of an atom&#8217;s mass; the number of protons and neutrons is an element&#8217;s mass number. Heavier and lighter versions of the same element can occur in nature because these versions have different numbers of neutrons. Different versions of an element are called isotopes.</p>
<p id="fs-id1273662">The tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily with other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the electrons within the atom&#8217;s outermost electron shell, called its valence shell. Helium, as well as larger atoms with eight electrons in their valence shell, is unlikely to participate in chemical reactions because they are stable. All other atoms tend to accept, donate, or share electrons in a process that brings the electrons in their valence shell to eight (or in the case of hydrogen, to two).</p>

<p id="fs-id1882994">Each moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and the other elements of the human body are making and breaking chemical bonds. Ions are charged atoms that form when an atom donates or accepts one or more negatively charged electrons. Cations (ions with a positive charge) are attracted to anions (ions with a negative charge). This attraction is called an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the participating atoms do not lose or gain electrons, but rather share them. Molecules with nonpolar covalent bonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear three-dimensional shape. Molecules with polar covalent bonds have &#8220;poles&#8221;&#8212;regions of weakly positive and negative charge&#8212;and have a triangular three-dimensional shape. An atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen form water molecules by means of polar covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds link hydrogen atoms already participating in polar covalent bonds to anions or electronegative regions of other polar molecules. Hydrogen bonds link water molecules, resulting in the properties of water that are important to living things.</p>

<p id="fs-id1278025">Chemical reactions, in which chemical bonds are broken and formed, require an initial investment of energy. Kinetic energy, the energy of matter in motion, fuels the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules that are necessary if their old bonds are to break and new ones to form. All molecules store potential energy, which is released when their bonds are broken.</p>
<p id="fs-id1700226">Four forms of energy essential to human functioning are: chemical energy, which is stored and released as chemical bonds are formed and broken; mechanical energy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant energy, emitted as waves such as in sunlight; and electrical energy, the power of moving electrons.</p>
<p id="fs-id1882994">Chemical reactions begin with reactants and end with products. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together, a process that requires energy, whereas decomposition reactions break the bonds within a reactant and thereby release energy. In exchange reactions, bonds are both broken and formed, and energy is exchanged.</p>
<p id="fs-id1470250">The rate at which chemical reactions occur is influenced by several properties of the reactants: temperature, concentration and pressure, and the presence or absence of a catalyst. An enzyme is a catalytic protein that speeds up chemical reactions in the human body.</p>

<p id="fs-id2017544">Inorganic compounds essential to human functioning include water, salts, acids, and bases. These compounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain both hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and cushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a byproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a reactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds that, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other than H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&#8211;</sup>. In contrast, acids release H<sup>+</sup> in solution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H<sup>+</sup>, thereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).</p>
<p id="fs-id1547332">The pH of any solution is its relative concentration of H<sup>+</sup>. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH below 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are bases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g., from 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease in the concentration of H<sup>+</sup>. In a healthy adult, the pH of blood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control mechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy pH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids and weak bases released when the pH of blood or other body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside of this normal range.</p>

<p id="fs-id1865776">Organic compounds essential to human functioning include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic because they contain both carbon and hydrogen. Carbon atoms in organic compounds readily share electrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually oxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also may bond with one or more functional groups such as carboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates. Monomers are single units of organic compounds. They bond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which can in turn be broken by hydrolysis.</p>
<p id="fs-id2347482">Carbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel. Their structural forms include monosaccharides such as glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and polysaccharides, including starches (polymers of glucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and fiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is converted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP.</p>
<p id="fs-id1645046">Lipids are hydrophobic compounds that provide body fuel and are important components of many biological compounds. Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid in the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone attached to three fatty acid chains. Phospholipids are compounds composed of a diglyceride with a phosphate group attached at the molecule&#8217;s head. The result is a molecule with polar and nonpolar regions. Steroids are lipids formed of four hydrocarbon rings. The most important is cholesterol. Prostaglandins are signaling molecules derived from unsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p id="fs-id2336120">Proteins are critical components of all body tissues. They are made up of monomers called amino acids, which contain nitrogen, joined by peptide bonds. Protein shape is critical to its function. Most body proteins are globular. An example is enzymes, which catalyze chemical reactions.</p>
<p id="fs-id2450246">Nucleotides are compounds with three building blocks: one or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a nitrogen-containing base. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids that function in protein synthesis. ATP is the body&#8217;s fundamental molecule of energy transfer. Removal or addition of phosphates releases or invests energy.</p>

<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="fs-id1953634" data-label="">
<p id="fs-id2302120">Lemon juice, like any acid, releases hydrogen ions in solution. As excessive H<sup>+</sup> enters the digestive tract and is absorbed into blood, Eli&#8217;s blood pH falls below 7.35. Recall that bicarbonate is a buffer, a weak base that accepts hydrogen ions. By administering bicarbonate intravenously, the emergency department physician helps raise Eli&#8217;s blood pH back toward neutral.</p>
