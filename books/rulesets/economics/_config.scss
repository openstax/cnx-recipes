  **Notes:** Even without the styling you can see a few problems with the ruleset code:

  1. the rulesets use the class attribute when they should use the `data-type`
  1. the solution is being duplicated
  1. the solution is inside the link text that points back to the problem
  1. new id's are generated rather than using the existing id attributes for the problem and solution
