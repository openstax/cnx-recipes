Employees net income (pay) results from gross income (pay) minus any involuntary and voluntary deductions. Employee payroll deductions may include federal, state, and local income taxes, FICA Social Security, FICA Medicare, and voluntary deductions such as health insurance, retirement plan contributions, and union dues. When recording employee payroll liabilities, Salaries Expense, Salaries Payable, and all payables for income taxes, Social Security, Medicare and voluntary deductions are reported. When the company pays the accrued salaries, Salaries Payable is reduced, as is Cash.</p>
