The drug store purchases large quantities of toothpaste from a wholesale distributor. They may purchase tens of thousands of tubes of toothpaste to get a better per-tube cost. They then add their mark-up (or profit) to the tube and offer it for sale to you, a single tube at a time. The drug store did not manufacture the toothpaste, instead they are reselling the toothpaste they acquired from the wholesaler.
