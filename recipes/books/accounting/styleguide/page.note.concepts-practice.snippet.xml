In this form, Roku disclosed its intention to become a “publicly-traded company,” meaning its stock will trade (sell) on public stock exchanges, allowing individual and institutional investors an opportunity to own a portion (shares) of the company. The Form S-1 included detailed financial and non-financial information about the company. The information from Roku also included the purpose of the offering as well as the intended uses of the funds. Here is a portion of the disclosure:</p>
  <blockquote id="auto_9ca4a588-153a-4e77-a026-dcd1e62a80c4_eip-id1171821585311">The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility and create a public market for our Class A common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development, business development, sales and marketing activities and capital expenditures</blockquote>
  <p id="auto_9ca4a588-153a-4e77-a026-dcd1e62a80c4_eip-id1171821564548">On September 28, 2017, Roku “went public” and exceeded expectations. Prior to the IPO, Roku estimated it would sell between $12-$14 per share, raising over $117 million for the company. The closing price per share on September 28 was $23.50, nearly doubling initial expectations for the share value (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/history?p=ROKU).</p></div>
